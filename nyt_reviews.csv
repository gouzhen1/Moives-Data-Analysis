It is also a smart, pointed satire that demolishes the hypocrisy of a conservative culture that allows almost unlimited violence and gore in movies and on television but goes ballistic at the prospect of children's being exposed to dirty language and sexual explicitness. When a group of tykes sneak into a Canadian movie filled with obscenities and come home spewing smut, their parents raise such a ruckus that the United States declares war on Canada. Armageddon looms when the Devil, who has been having a troubled affair with the recently deceased Saddam Hussein, decides to put in an appearance. Contributing to the madness are 15 clever songs spoofing everything from Rodgers and Hammerstein to &quot;Les Miserables.&quot; — Stephen Holden"

The results are irresistible, at least for audiences on the film's laid-back wavelength and in tune with its deadpan humor. With shaggy, baggy looks that belie his performance's fine comic control, Jeff Bridges plays a guy who truly deserves to be called Dude, and is by turns oblivious and indignant once a ruined rug leads him into neo-noir escapades. In a film that certainly keeps its audience guessing what might happen next (Saddam Hussein renting bowling shoes?), John Turturro takes the cake as the most fiendish of bowlers. — Janet Maslin"
