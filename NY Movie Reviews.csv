Soon after the agent Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) lands in the F.B.I.'s Albuquerque bureau, he discovers a man's mutilated body carefully arranged amid the cacti and sand. One thing leads to another leads to a halfway house where twitchy Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) scratches out the kind of eerily beautiful artwork so beloved of movie sociopaths.

The narrative, hopping around the sad, garish notcturnal landscape of lower-middle-class Mexico City, unfolds in real time with the jumpy irritability of a 90-minute nicotine fit. A computer hacker (Diego Luna) takes a break from spying on his neighbor to go in on some shady business with Russian mobsters, and the ensuing wave of grisly, jokey violence sweeps up the unsuspecting proprietors of a modes beauty salon and a small pharmacy. In spite of the interesting cast and Hugo Rodríguez's deft sense of timing, the movie is little more than yet another numbing, dumbing exercise in warmed-over cool. &#151; A. O. Scott"

It is all a bit too symmetrical — a bedroom farce without a sense of humor — and the characters float free of any credible social context. But this dark, cracked crystal of a film nonetheless works as a kind of marital film noir, with the threat of emotional violence hanging over every scene.

A mythic European country where everyone speaks accented English by way of Britain, France and Brooklyn, Genovia is the adopted home of Princess Mia (Anne Hathaway), a one-time San Francisco teenager-turned-old-world pretender. Unlike Pinocchio, Mia doesn't hang her wish on just any star; she hangs it on the movie-made promise that every girl can find her inner princess and, like, you know, rule. Directed by Garry Marshall, who's been selling wish-fulfillment fantasies for years, most notably in &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; and written by Shonda Rhimes, &quot;The Princess Diaries 2&quot; combines a classic storybook scenario, in which the former ugly duckling refines her swan standing, with the usual self-help uplift.

Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, &quot;Collateral&quot; scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up even at night, how cars become prostheses of our selves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, &quot;Collateral&quot; is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job, which explains why this fastidiously crafted commercial film isn't just an entertainment, but a statement of personal faith. — Manohla Dargis"

The film, simply and efficiently shot without special effects or well-known actors, evokes some deep and primal fears, but it is ultimately too small, too under-dramatized, to provoke anything more intense than squirming discomfort.

Denzel Washington plays Ben Marco, a Gulf War veteran haunted by nightmares who tries at once to hold onto his sanity and to unravel a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of corporate and political power. Liev Schreiber is a young congressman propelled toward the vice presidency by his monstrous mother, played with ice-chomping glee by Meryl Streep. The convolutions of the story are less important than the vigor of the performances, and the movie wears its attenuated political relevance lightly.

Imagine the Grace Kelly of &quot;Rear Window&quot; or the Kim Novak of &quot;Vertigo&quot; sprawled seductively on an analyst's couch, smoking cigarettes and confiding her sexual frustration to a repressed, wide-eyed shrink who is obsessed with her. The movie establishes a mood of playful erotic suspense in the first 10 minutes and sustains its cat-and-mouse game between therapist and patient through variations that are by turns amusing, titillating and mildly scary. The running joke is its revelation at the outset that the shrink (Fabrice Luchini) is not really a therapist but a repressed, lonely tax accountant.  Ms. Bonnaire's troubled character has accidentally strayed into the wrong office, located  on the same floor where the psychoanalyst she intended to consult practices a few doors  away.

The New Jersey suburban landscape to which Andrew, Mr. Braff's 26-year-old alter ego, returns from self-imposed exile in Los Angeles is a universe apart from the lotus land where he has lived in for the last nine years in a chemical stupor. Because &quot;The Graduate&quot; established the stock vision of suburban alienation that has persisted through  &quot;American Beauty&quot; and beyond, you expect &quot;Garden State&quot; to uphold the cliché. Instead, it allows Andrew to discover some nuggets of spiritual gold in the East Coast wasteland he dreaded revisiting.

The carelessness with which the director hurls his feelings about hot-button topics onto the screen is the filmmaking equivalent of a last-ditch marketing:  grab everything in sight, roll it up into a big messy mud ball, and hurl it against the wall, hoping that something sticks. Lashing out in all directions, the director addresses white collar crime, the Bush administration, AIDS in Africa, the Mafia, Watergate, sex and reproduction, lesbianism and the meaning of family in a disoriented rant that lurches from one subject to the next with little to tie it together. A sex farce one minute, a crude political skit the next, an imitation &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; harangue the next, &quot;She Hate Me&quot; can't maintain its focus long enough to say anything fresh.

There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies, counterspies from Russia and America tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. In this sequel to &quot;The Bourne Identity,&quot; many of the major hands who created the first film have returned, including Matt Damon as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), the C.I.A.-trained assassin who can't remember his name or exactly why he's being hunted by everybody. As before, he spends almost the entire movie on the run. The movie reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format.

The movie follows the desperate plunge of Maria (Catalina Sandino  Moreno) from a dead-end job as an assembly-line worker in a Colombian flower factory  into the drug-smuggling underworld. Her dangerous undertaking is her last resort when she finds herself unemployed and pregnant. Before the story zeroes in on the harrowing details of drug running and its dangers, it details Maria's hopelessly circumscribed life in a rural village. If her story is a template for countless others like it, what keeps your heart in your throat is Maria herself. In a performance that feels more lived in than acted, Ms.  Moreno's Maria is an attractive, smart, spirited young woman who faces the challenge of  fending for herself with a fierce determination and ingenuity that compromises but never  undermines her essential decency and morality. The movie sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is off-handed.

That ghost haunts the movie's troubled young  protagonist Alim (Jimi Mistry), a gay South Asian Muslim leaving with a British lover in  London. The movie is the latest manifestation of an already stale sub-sub genre: the  multicultural romance in which a gay couple of mixed ethnicity tries to conceal their  relationship from visiting tradition-bound relatives who assume the lovers are  heterosexual roommates.

Jon Foster plays Eddie, a prep school student who spends a long, eventful summer working as an assistant to Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges), a famous writer and illustrator of children's books. Ted and his wife, Marion (Kim Basinger), are still grieving over the loss of their two sons in a car accident years before, and their marriage is falling apart. All of this might have made for maudlin, precious melodrama — especially when Eddie and Marion commence their affair — but rather than emphasize the plot, Mr. Williams makes it a relaxed, roomy landscape for the characters to roam around in. The cast rises above the occasional implausibility of the material, and the movie is funny, touching and understated. It is dominated by Mr. Bridges's performance, one of the finest pieces of screen acting by an American man so far this year, a heroically life-sized portrait of wounded narcissism and masculine need. — A.

At its core, &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot; is the portrait of a marriage: the angry, sustaining partnership between James Hetfield, the lead singer, and Lars Ulrich, the drummer, who founded the band as teenagers and must figure out how to keep it going now that they're in their 40's. &#151; A.

The central  character, Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen), forsakes a carefree life in Stockholm to assume  control of his family's floundering steel works after his father commits suicide. Part of  the story revolves around the tug of war between his domineering mother (Ghita Norby)  and his beautiful wife (Lisa Werlinder), who puts her promising acting career on hold to move from Stockholm to Copenhagen. &quot;The Inheritance&quot; reminds you in painful detail that one of the tasks of a financially responsible executive is to execute. As he turns the business around, his decisions tear apart his family and erode his marriage. You can read the Danish film as an unsettling parable about any corporation, or, for that matter, any country forced to take stringent financial measures to avoid catastrophe. For all the pain he inflicts, Christoffer might even be seen as a self-sacrificing hero. But as the morose movie shows, a corporate hero is many ways the antithesis of a humanitarian. — Stephen Holden"

For all its excitement, Stacy Peralta's follow-up to his skateboarding movie &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; lacks the quirky, personal touch of its forerunner. Though it has its share of cheek, it is a more formal survey of a sport that is already well documented. The history of surfing, one commentator remarks, can be divided into eras: before and after &quot;Gidget.&quot; The closer the movie draws to the present, the more concentrated is its attention to innovative stars like Greg Noll, Jeff  Clark and Laird Hamilton and their quest to ride the biggest, scariest waves. &#151; Stephen Holden"

The movie's ideas are none too fresh — the crazy sideburns and ugly neckties of the 1970's will only yield so much hilarity — but there is a reasonably high quotient of funny jokes and off-the-wall, nutty gags, including a street fight among rival news teams as amusing for its movie-star cameos as for it brutal slapstick. — A.

Their intimacy is tinged with nostalgic regret. The airy sense of freedom   that they shared in their early 20's has given way to the resignation of adulthood, even as they meander toward a second chance. The liberating   sweetness of the earlier movie has mellowed into a saltier, sadder flavor, but Richard Linklater, one of our most literate and intelligent directors, has not talked himself out of the possibility of romance, and the movie's relaxed, discursive structure is dense with implied feeling and oblique drama. — A.

Although its publicity goes out of its way to pat the movie on the back for its supposed candor about Porter's homosexuality, the film's attitude toward sex is dainty. The heat in a film about the man who wrote &quot;Too Darn Hot&quot; remains a steady, air-conditioned 68 degrees. It can't imagine a wealthy, sophisticated couple marrying for friendship and social advantage without that arrangement involving torment and guilt over its lack of sex. Some two dozen Porter songs are glossed by contemporary singers like Elvis Costello (&quot;Let's Misbehave&quot;), Alanis Morissette (&quot;Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love&quot;),  Sheryl Crow (&quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;) and Diana Krall (&quot;Just One of Those Things&quot;).

In answer, this intelligent, hectoring documentary offers an elaborate psychopathology of dishonest, unscrupulous and predatory behaviors, which are seen as expressions of the corporation's fundamental nature. Case studies in environmental pollution, aggressive branding, the exploitation of workers and the abuse of technology alternate with more general disquisitions on the brutal logic of global capitalism. The talking heads are mainly activists and scholars — Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore, among others — with a few C.E.O.'s and orthodox economists thrown in for balance. While much of the material is persuasive, the film ensnares itself in contradictions it does not acknowledge, and paints a grim, tendentious picture of the modern world.

His powers are waning, he has lost the respect of the woman he loves, and even Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) seems a little disappointed in him. Meanwhile, a new supervillain, the tragic and terrifying Doc Ock (Mr. Molina), rampages through New York on mechanical arms with minds of their own. There is plenty of noise and color, and some so-so special effects, but the real thrill comes from Sam Raimi's devotion to his hero's complex, conflicted emotional life, and to the melancholy, grown-up love story that develops between Peter and MJ (Kirsten Dunst), who comes into her own as a strong and decisive character, while still fulfilling the traditional comic-book girlfriend duties of screaming, getting kidnapped and being rescued. — A.

But once you accept the anthropomorphic premise that a gentle pussycat lurks inside of the most ferocious tiger, the movie succeeds as an inspirational pastorale and passionate moral brief for animal rights and preservation. It also inveighs unequivocally against one culture's looting of another's historical treasures. The movie isn't as gripping as the director's much-loved 1988 film, &quot;The Bear.&quot; But when it concentrates on its animal stars (each played by several tigers), it remains on solid ground.

Beyond the smooches, sighs and adoring glances, how do you convey the reality of a shared, private paradise? In the strongest scenes of the screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's treacly best seller, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams break through the barrier to evoke high-strung, slightly crazed teenagers plunging headlong into first love. Against your better judgment, you root for them to beat the odds against them. The romantic drama, which spans six decades, is told in flashback as Duke (James Garner), a garrulous, ailing old codger in a comfortable nursing home, reads aloud excerpts of a love story to a woman (Gena Rowlands) suffering from Alzheimer's disease. As the movie seesaws between Seabrook, N.C., in the summer of 1940, when the young lovers in the story meet, and the present, it is deliberately (and annoyingly) coy as to who these oldsters might be.

What sounds like a nightmare turns out to be a soothing comic dream, thanks to Steven Spielberg's playful virtuosity, and also to the talents of the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who infuses the neutral, unwelcoming architecture of the airport with soft, radiant light. The story is a bit soft: Viktor is befriended by a motley group of airport workers, bedeviled by a Homeland Security apparatchik (Stanley Tucci) and beguiled by an unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). There is a bit too much easy sentiment and artificial sweetness, and Ms. Zeta-Jones's character is woefully underwritten. But these flaws cannot dispel the film's deep enchantment. Mr. Hanks, like Mr. Spielberg, has nothing left to prove, and the nuances lurking in his sly, genial performance emerge only in retrospect. Similarly, the movie's deepest engagement with some of the central anxieties of modern life can be found not in its plot but in its ambience.

The latest remake of Jules Verne's 1873 globetrotting fantasy is a deliriously silly caper that goes out of its way to thumb its nose at logic. This swatch of epic slapstick, in which three madcap adventurers from London play beat-the-clock in a race to circle the earth, is really a silent comedy with spoken subtitles. What distinguishes this rendition from the nearly three-hour 1956 version, which won the Oscar for best picture, is the presence of that coiled human whirlwind Jackie Chan. As Passepartout, the loyal valet to the fanatical British inventor Phileas Fogg (Steve Coogan), Mr. Chan makes his entrance diving out of a window in a Keystone Kops-style chase. The whiz-bang set pieces in which he fends off teams of assailants in exotic locales are the movie's high points. The film's witty Rube Goldberg-worthy contraptions remind us that until today's high tech environment, machines used to be funny.

The film, written by Mr. Hess, a 24-year-old former student at Brigham Young University, and his 23-year-old wife, Jerusha, works best as a series of deadpan visual and verbal gags. Even the trained actors in the cast perform with the hesitant, awkward opacity of non-professionals, and their awkwardness is clearly, for Mr. Hess, a sign of authenticity.

In bodybuilding terms, this overmuscled sequel to &quot;Pitch Black&quot; is all bulk and no definition. In touch with the grunting, preening culture of professional wrestling, the negligible screenplay by David Twohy, who directed  both movies, is crammed with trailer-ready taglines. Intoned by Vin Diesel with a sly comic gravity, these enigmatic blurbs mean next to nothing. Returning from &quot;Pitch  Black,&quot; Mr. Diesel's character, Riddick, a fugitive from a distant planet, pursued across the universe by bounty hunters, might be described as the heavy-metal version of Brad Pitt's Achilles in &quot;Troy.&quot; Here he runs afoul of the Necromongers, an evil race of conquerors.

The film's major weakness, sad to say, is Harry himself. Approaching adolescence, Daniel Radcliffe may also be reaching the limit of his range as an actor; he seems unable to summon the complex, volatile emotions that the story, with its notes of grief and rage amid the usual boarding-school intrigue, demands.

But the extraordinarily clear-sighted  and psychologically balanced British drama stares as calmly at May's perilous leap into churning emotional rapids as a medical show does when keeping its gaze fixed on a tricky surgical procedure. The bravery of Ms. Reid's screen performance can be measured by her utter  lack of self-consciousness when naked before the camera. When desire trumps May's  maternal feelings, and she knowingly (and guiltily) risks exile from her family to pursue  a hopeless infatuation, she is achingly believable. Hanif Kureishi's screenplay is infused  with an unwavering Chekhovian compassion. Neither good nor evil, its characters are  complicated, ordinary people coping as best they can with their emotional wounds and  their fear of the future, grabbing at illusions of salvation and whatever zest they can drag  into their lives, even while suspecting that the most passion can provide is a temporary  quick fix. — Stephen Holden"

Her life of fun, fun, fun comes to a screeching halt when her older sister and her husband are killed in a car crash, and the will gives Helen custody of three orphaned children. The rest of the movie tells the warm and fuzzy story of Helen's bumbling surrogate parenthood to the brood she inherits, and her discovery of family values and true romance in an outer borough.

This is a shame, since the bright young cast (especially Mandy Moore, relishing the chance to play a villainous, self-righteous teenage queen be) performs with conviction and high spirits. Jena Malone plays Mary, who becomes pregnant while trying to cure her gay boyfriend and whose crisis separates the pious hypocrites from the decent folk.

As you watch cities obliterated by wind, water and ice, you don't think &quot;My God, how horrible&quot;; you think, &quot;cool!&quot; The only one who seems genuinely worried is Dennis Quaid, playing a scientist whose apocalyptic warnings are ignored until it's too late.

The rococo fantasy, tricked out with animation and with actors sailing like little Supermen through toy cutout clouds, belongs to the same school of whimsical excess as  &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; and &quot;Amelie.&quot; But as the movie glides along, its story turns considerably darker than its fluffy, candy-colored forerunners. Narrated by its  protagonist (Guillaume Canet), the movie follows the increasingly destructive games of one-upmanship he plays over three decades with his closest childhood friend (Marion  Cotillard). The two meet as 8-year-old children and enter a private world in which  they dare each other to carry out increasingly outrageous pranks. On one level, the movie  is a parable of the battle of the sexes.

Not that the people in the film are always having such a good time: they seem, rather, to get on one another's nerves with some regularity. Some of the chapters are almost vanishingly slight —  hipster anecdotes that float away like smoke rings. Others —  notably a hotel bar encounter in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and a resentful cousin and a game of celebrity one-upmanship between Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan —  have the compact perfection of good one-act plays.

Yes, the score is dreadful and the dialogue sometimes painfully obvious, but Wolfgang Petersen and David Benioff take the ancient world and its notions of war seriously. Brad Pitt, in spite of an odd pseudo-English accent (perhaps adopted in deference to the mostly British and Australian cast), plays Achilles with wit and charisma, turning the character into a kind of existentialist warrior rock star. Eric Bana, as Achilles' Trojan counterpart and nemesis, Hector, has a brooding sensitivity that contrasts with Mr. Pitt's brashness. Some of the battle scenes have a vigorous old-time grandeur, and though it takes some inevitable liberties with the source material, the film is more astute about the political and moral complexities of war than most recent combat pictures. — A.

Shortly after Hong Jong-Du (Sol Kyung-gu), the learning-disabled middle brother of three sons  in a bourgeois Korean family, returns home after serving three years in prison, he  meets the more seriously disabled Han Gong-Ju (Moon So-ri), who suffers from cerebral  palsy so severe she can't make herself understood. The passionate bond that develops between them brings them joy but leads to personal disaster. The film's extraordinary lead performances refuse to soft-pedal the severity of their afflictions. By not turning away, softening or adopting a saccharine tone, the film breaks through the couple's  isolation (and through our own prejudice and frustration) so that the sweethearts emerge  as full, achingly human characters. &#151; Stephen Holden"

The &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer and performer Tina Fey wrote the script and gives the material a stylized vitality. But it does add a be-yourself finale that, while standard for such movies, this picture doesn't quite seem to buy — it's the kind of bored manipulation you come to expect from the Plastics, the pack of hallway-shrewd and glamorous teen queens who rule, through subtle terror, the high school that Cady (Ms. Lohan) attends. It's her first brush with socialization, since Cady was home schooled by her zoologist parents, who raised their daughter while traveling in Africa. Since most of &quot;Girls&quot; consists of the outsider Cady observing the tribal rites of her new setting and laying it all out in narration, this movie is great home for the meticulous and ruthless deadpan that Ms. Fey has perfected for the satirical &quot;S.N.L.&quot; newscast. Though narrative cohesion isn't the strength of &quot;Girls&quot; — as a series of moments, it works better from scene to scene than as a whole — the intelligence shines in its understanding of contradictions. Scene by scene, you can't help but be impressed by &quot;Girls&quot;; it's like a group of sketches linked by theme, with some playing much better than others.

Mr. Caviezel's bland impenetrability may fit the screenplay's portrayal of Jones as a ferocious competitor who internalized stress and suffered physically for it, but his muted presence fails to create a compelling character. The movie, which wants to ennoble golf with the same spiritual mystique that &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; brought to running, is even more hushed in tone than its prototype.

And any movie that telegraphs its fondness for its cast automatically has something going for it that's rare in contemporary comedy; this isn't one of those movies in which most of the actors steer clear of upstaging the star. This spiritual decency, a handful of songs from the toddler days of MTV and a few other fillips of clear-eyed charm go a long way toward making up for the tiredness of the concept, a kid magically leapfrogging into the body of an adult. In this case, it's 13-year-old Jenna (Christa B. Allen), who's suffering through a miserable failure of a birthday.  When some magic dust that a friend gives her lands on her carefully moussed hair, she awakens from a nap as a 30-year-old version of herself (Jennifer Garner). As acted by Ms. Garner, Jenna has a coltish gawkiness that she never quite sublimates. The obvious laughs are wrung from the contrast of an inexperienced child in a mature body, as Jenna bobs through a world in which the supposed adults turn out to be more childish than she is. The performances give the movie more flavor and life than the situation, which often feels like pre-chewed Bubble Yum. — Elvis Mitchell"

The joy when Quentin Tarantino's creations speak is the opposite. Despite their hilariously florid rapping, his folks are also incredibly cagey: they never give the entire game away. This shrewdness is the template for the long dialogues in &quot;Kill Bill, Vol. 2,&quot; the most voluptuous comic-book movie ever made.   In this deliciously perverse picture, everything is operatic, including the despair and the pauses. Uma Thurman, whose speaking voice has a lyric, teasing quality, is just the performer to get the mordant slyness across. Mr. Tarantino's movies are also about loss and betrayal, and &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is a double-burger helping of those motifs. It is rich, substantial and sustained, yet also greasy kids' stuff, a wrapper filled with an extra large order of chili fries, stained with ketchup, salt and cheese. &quot;Vol. 1&quot; was all set-up: the longest first act in movie history, staged and edited like a series of Pablo Ferro trailers. &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is the second and third acts in one convenient serving, told in a languorous flashback-within-a-flashback style with airy long takes. Unlike the 100-meter high-hurdles of &quot;Vol. 1,&quot; this sequel is a marathon, with hills and long stretches of flatland. As in the first film, the Bride (Ms. Thurman) is on a mission of vengeance after being shot and left for dead; she's out to murder her former colleagues led by Bill (David Carradine). She calls her journey a roaring rampage of revenge. The movie, which quivers with a geek-adrenaline rush, in some ways feels like its time may have passed; this feels likes a movie Mr. Tarantino might have made before &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell"

Here Connie (Nia  Vardalos) and Carla (Toni Collette), two  bedraggled female veterans of the dinner-theater circuit on the run from mobsters, become  overnight (and highly unlikely) cult stars by posing as gay drag performers singing  Broadway standards. The movie knows and doesn't care that it has only the most tenuous connection to the real world. As drag performers, Ms. Collette (who at times resembles John Epperson as Lypsinka) is far more adroit at caricature than Ms. Vardalos, whose alter-ego suggests a homier, drag version of Kathy Najimy with a smirk that evokes traces of Mary Martin and Phyllis Diller.

Anne Hathaway, the vivacious young star of &quot;The Princess Diaries,&quot; plays the title character, a put-upon teenager in a storybook world whose widowed father (Patrick Bergin) has injudiciously married Dame Olga (Joanna Lumley, of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;), the mother of all wicked stepmothers.  She comes complete with a pair of entertainingly hateful daughters (Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham), who like nothing better than torturing Ella — particularly once they discover that, thanks to a questionable gift bestowed by a fairy (Vivica A.

As Ella sets out to find the errant fairy and convince her to revoke her dubious present, the screenwriters Laurie Craig, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (working from a novel by Gail Carson Levine) take her through various effects-filled realms, including a land where elves are forced by the evil regent to sing, dance and be relentlessly merry, and a forced labor compound for giants that looks disturbingly like a concentration camp.

This is an accomplishment of sorts, generally the sort that no one plans. The director, John Lee Hancock, strains so mightily to bring a human aspect to the material that the movie limps as if it has a pulled muscle.

Guillermo del Toro has brought a similar woozy, disconcerting melancholy to his film adaptation, and his obvious affection and affinity  for that dankness alone would make &quot;Hellboy&quot; worth seeing. But Mr. del Toro lets loose with an all-American, vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes the movie daffy, loose and lovable. The story is pretty complicated stuff: during World War II, Hitler sends a special squad, led by Rasputin (Karel Roden), to rend the dimensional bonds and obtain a creature that will give the edge to the Nazis. His conjuring leads to the emergence of an infant creature, red as sin, with a long tail, who falls into the hands of the Allies. The kindly British scientist Dr. Broom (John Hurt) tames the tiny scarlet devil with a Baby Ruth the size of a Bazooka. Adopted by Dr. Broom, Hellboy, with his huge stone-like left arm, grows up to be the go-to guy for the good doctor and the anti-apparition league known as the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. What gives &quot;Hellboy&quot; squirmy, ferocious life is the environment that Mr. del Toro creates onscreen. It's this texture that he avidly lavishes on &quot;Hellboy&quot; that offers the kiss of distinction.  It's an elegant haunted house of a picture, with dread and yearning part of the eeriness. Ron Perlman's performance as Hellboy, and his mastery of bad-tempered volubility, makes the film a kind of screwball comedy version of the Thing from the Fantastic Four comics. Like any American comedy protagonist, he's always trying to explain himself and do what's right. That ambition is what gets him into trouble and is the truest definition of Hell. — Elvis Mitchell"

With a brisk running time of 85 minutes, there is no more fat on &quot;Walking Tall&quot; than there is on the Rock himself, a hulking yet curiously ingratiating presence who seems the most likely candidate to replace Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as America's favorite living comic book character. — Dave Kehr"

DMX stars as the drug dealer King David, who pops up in the streets again after a long absence. Rolling into the frame in a player's classic — a late 70's Stutz Blackhawk — King David shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life. He quickly reaps what he sows and, mortally wounded, passes all his worldly goods to Paul (David Arquette), a scrambling white would-be writer.

It's the highlights of King David's high life that propel &quot;Alone.&quot; Like all of Goines's heroes, King David is a scourge on the periphery, and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity. Every life he touches he leaves in ruins — a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit, and DMX signals that motivation with sly hostility.

The group battles the seemingly supernatural apparitions that beset the back-lot town of Coolsville.  Like the first film, &quot;Scooby Doo 2&quot; was directed by Raja Gosnell, a protégée of and former film editor for Chris Columbus, the maker of the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.  Mr. Gosnell does his best to recreate the Potter blend of mild spookiness and kiddie comedy, but the material just isn't as psychologically rich as J. K. Rowling's shrewd combination of adolescent self-pity and violent revenge fantasy. &#151; Dave Kehr"

Ben Affleck as the high-powered flack and reluctant father is tolerable as a selfish, arrogant,  Manhattan handmaiden to the stars. It's when he's required to change into a simpler, nicer guy that the actor gets into trouble, straining in vain to twist his natural sneer into a smile.

The picture's rhythms are too choppy to achieve the grandeur of epic, and the performances (with the exception of Orlando Bloom as Kelly's sidekick) are lifeless and unmemorable.

Even as you laugh, it's a movie you admire more than love. Mr. Gondry, displaying an impressively quicksilver, scrambling technique, is working with a much better script than he had for &quot;Human Nature,&quot; his previous collaboration with the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (&quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; &quot;Adaptation&quot;).  Kate Winslet is Clem, the brash, loquacious bookstore employee who meets Joel (Jim Carrey) as he wanders the streets alone on Valentine's Day. The two of them fall in love under a glum, flannel cloud cover that could use some eternal sunshine.  After they break up, Joel's ego is bruised when he finds out that Clem has had all memories of him erased from her mind. Devastated, he goes for the same treatment. Mr. Kaufman has conjured the film equivalent of a Philip K. Dick Hallmark card. The movie has all of the knickknacks of a Kaufman script, including a nerdy, socially inept protagonist. In the case of &quot;Mind,&quot; this translates into Joel's being the least developed character. Mr. Carrey does get to show some aplomb in the final scene, when Joel acts out the most mature sentiment ever found in a Kaufman script, that having one's psyche purged isn't necessarily a good thing. What becomes of the broken-hearted, after the conversation has dimmed, is that they get over it. And by concluding with an adult realization, the film lets sunlight peek through the gloom, in more ways than one. — Elvis Mitchell"

The film, with many subplots, blurs the line between comedy and  epic drama so adroitly that the two styles fuse into something quite original: a lyrical  farce that pays homage to its period in any number of ways.

Still, this is the first studio picture to exhibit the tacky Troma influence, which means something, like the end of shame in Western civilization, perhaps. The first undead we see in this &quot;reimagining&quot; of the George Romero classic is a little girl with part of her face rotted away, who goes right for her dad's neck. The mother, Ana (Sarah Polley), barely escapes the house intact, and drives away. She runs into Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a uniformed cop. They make their way to the Crossroad Mall, where a handful of security guards have taken up residence. They're determined to keep the zombies out, especially once Ana figures out that the life-free scourge is spread from a zombie bite. A scene in which weapons have to be liberated from a gun store, so the group can get to a marina and sail away to safety — don't ask —  shows why zombie pictures aren't unsettling anymore.

The result is this altogether compelling Irish comedy-drama. The first scene of the picture serves as an announcement of its intentions and is emblematic of the film's approach. Strolling into a restaurant and trilling his consonants as if he were trying to add an extra layer of moss to his accent, the roguish Lehiff (Colin Farrell) wins over the girl behind the counter, and the scene spins wildly into something else entirely. The shock &#151;  both comic and finally horrific  &#151; gives the movie the fizz of unpredictability. Surprise hovers over &quot;Intermission&quot; like a creature waiting to stun the cast of the movie into submission.  What Mr. Crowley and the screenwriter Mark Rowe have done is assemble a group of actors whose feistiness keeps the doom that drips around the corners of the frame from consuming them all whole. The tangle of intersecting lives is what keep the movie thorny, and forces the actors to stay alert.  Though a bank robbery is fundamentally the center of the action, following the characters around is really what &quot;Intermission&quot; is all about.

A suspense thriller whose only suspense, and thrills, comes from an audience wondering if the picture will hit its promised 97-minute running time, &quot;Secret Window&quot; dramatizes Mort's plight. He's suffering from writer's block, triggered by the tumultuous break-up of his marriage to Amy (Maria Bello), and the protracted divorce proceedings. Mort lives in a remote cabin until a thunderous knock at the door rouses him from a sofa almost as lived-in as his bathrobe. The visitor is John Shooter (John Turturro), who drawls menacingly, &quot;You stole my book.&quot; Sleepy and astounded, Mort gets the evidence shoved into his life.  Shooter's short story reads exactly like Mort's best-selling murder mystery, &quot;Secret Window.&quot; What's worse, Shooter gives Mort three days to set things right, or else. What little intrigue the movie has comes from Mort's shattered self-esteem; he asks himself if he really was capable of stealing Shooter's story vowel for vowel.

Val Kilmer, his sorrowful cool nicely suited to the fiercely stylized acting Mr. Mamet requires, plays a secret agent who must rescue the kidnapped daughter of a prominent politician.

Otherwise, things are pretty much the same, as the screenwriters Don Rhymer, Harald Zwart and Dylan Sellers do their best to duplicate the first film's blend of James Bondish adventure and adolescent anxieties. Young Cody is assigned by the director of the C.I.A.

Directed by the British filmmaker Kevin Allen (&quot;Twin Town,&quot; &quot;The Big Tease&quot;), &quot;Cody Banks 2&quot; is full of chase sequences and comic battles, but Mr. Allen's work is compromised by an apparent inability to match his shots in a spatially coherent fashion.

The original series featured a pair of apparently plainclothes cops — who were they supposed to be fooling? — played by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. Mr. Phillips may not quite be a filmmaker, but he's on his way to becoming a director; his grasp of tone is a few steps ahead of his previous film, &quot;Old School.&quot; Starsky (Ben Stiller) is probably one of those rare detectives who don't deserve the by-the-book speeches from their commanders. He is paired with another loner — cool, shaggy Hutch (Owen Wilson) — who's a step away from being bounced from the force. Starsky and Hutch are tethered to a harness of buddy-movie clichés, but their congeniality comes from the actors' chemistry, demonstrated in five previous films. 
Eschewing the confrontational machismo of the television series, the movie instead plays Starsky's zealous obliviousness against Hutch's low-rent worldliness.

In 1989, just before the fall of the German Democratic Republic, Christiane (Katrin Sass) sees her son beaten by police during a riot.

Any sudden shock could kill her, so Alex contrives to keep her convinced that things are still the same. Alex has to rescue the paste-board furniture that he and his sister were happy to heave onto a junk heap; the utilitarian design of the furniture seems to inform us that East Berlin may have been where Ikea got its ideas from.

Its story, which sends the enormous red dog and his pals, Cleo and T-Bone, out on the road with a traveling carnival, is bland and innocuous, as every hint of trouble is quickly turned into a soothing lesson. The gaudy, unimaginative animation is a step down from the simplicity of the series, and adults may find the cloying harmlessness oppressive.

A far-fetched plotline finds a former President of the United States (Gene Hackman) running for mayor of a small New England town against beloved local son and all-purpose handyman Ray Romano.  They're also competing for the affections of the local veterinarian, played by Maura Tierney.  The picture is oversupplied with excellent actors — also in the cast are Rip Torn as Cole's chief political advisor and Marcia Gay Harden as Cole's dedicated executive secretary — but undersupplied with wit and dramatic interest.  The immensely likable Mr. Romano (star of television's &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;) and the charmingly pouty Ms. Tierney (a regular on &quot;E. R.&quot;) make a lovely sitcom couple, and &quot;Mooseport&quot; could easily serve as a pilot for a new series, should they ever decide to abandon their current sinecures.  Mr. Hackman fills the role of special guest star, floating above and apart from the rest of the cast, descending occasionally for a verbal wrestling bout or a bit of broad slapstick. — Dave Kehr"

The script is pretty much one cliché after another, and Charles S.

His newest film, an ardently romantic love song to sex, cinema and the spirit of the 60's, elaborates on this observation by finding sweetness in the midst of political tumult. The disturbances of 1968 in Paris take place mostly off screen, bursting in only at the end to wake up the three title characters. The trio —  an American exchange student (Michael Pitt) and a pair of lovely, moody half-French twins (Eva Green and Louis Garrel) — spend most of the picture holed up in a luxuriously squalid Paris apartment, having sex and arguing about movies, politics and the relative merits of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. Instead of mocking or patronizing their passion (as some critics are sure to do), Mr. Bertolucci treats these silly, earnest, beautiful young people tenderly and with generosity. As a testament to their love of movies, he inserts archival film clips culled from the repertory of the Cinémathèque Française, where the three met and where the events of May began. To feed the audiences love, he photographs his fearless young actors and their surroundings with breathtaking grace.

Disney, the studio that brought us &quot;The Rookie&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; (the movie and the team/merchandising operation), has no such restraint.

The movie's  cheerful view of contemporary Havana is markedly different from Wim Wenders' elegiac  &quot;Buena Vista Social Club.&quot; &#151; Stephen Holden"

The motorcycle-riding morons circle one another, hissing threats and flaring their nostrils as if they were about to lash their wrists together and break into a dance number reminiscent of Michael Jackson's &quot;Beat It&quot; video. They also do a lot of flexing and flashing of their tattoos — which look like wall appliqués for a particularly surly 6-year-old's bedroom — and seem to spend more time primping than Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie. Chief among these idiots is Ford (Martin Henderson), who's just returned from either a restful vacation in Thailand, or a flight there from his enemies. But he can't just ride around greater downtown Barstow on his bike or tune-up his misfiring relationship with his ex-girl Shane (Monet Mazur), a bike shop owner he abandoned. He's being stalked by the menacing motorcycle gang leader Henry  (Matt Schulze), who runs a lucrative crystal Meth business. Ford has possession of some of Henry's drugs and he wants his valuable stash returned, or else. Henry has worked the competing gang leader Trey's bandanna into a knot; he tried to persuade Trey (Ice Cube) into joining the drug business, but he refused. Henry kills Trey's little brother and frames Ford for the crime. Now, in addition to Henry's boys, the police and Trey's squad also are out to put their hands on Ford, who has to slip past all of them to get to Los Angeles. Why? So the film can show its true colors as a tribute to Walter Hill's haiku of a gang action classic, &quot;The Warriors,&quot; a movie that has less dialogue and far more wit than &quot;Torque.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell"

J. Hogan's adaptation of J. M.

While Peter (Jeremy Sumpter) is appropriately dashing and adventurous, Hook (Jason Isaacs) wonderfully villainous and Tinker Bell (Ludivine Sagnier) as cute and naughty as anyone could wish, the movie belongs to Rachel Hurd-Wood's Wendy Darling. Ms. Hurd-Wood, a 13-year-old British actress making her professional debut, was born for the role, which calls on her to be a precocious child, an action heroine, the surrogate mother of a tribe of Lost Boys, and the romantic lead. Her soft, sensitive features display both Wendy's child-like eagerness and her incipient wisdom without overdoing either trait, and she and Mr. Sumpter remind us that Peter Pan, beyond all the swashbuckling and fantasy, is a love story, which ends on a poignant Jamesian note of renunciation. The sets and special effects are rousing and vivid, but what distinguishes this Peter Pan from the other versions (and from most recent children s entertainment) is its unsentimental insight into the terrors and delights of both childhood and growing up. — A.

Since then, Dick's posthumous legacy has suffered through movies like &quot;Impostor,&quot; and Mr. Woo made &quot;Windtalkers.&quot;  But their new meeting of temperaments is surprisingly adept, given that it's basically a dumb movie about smart people. This smooth but bland thriller may be the best we could possibly expect from such a collaboration, especially when Ben Affleck — an actor whose becalmed exterior reflects an inability to project an inner life — is added to the mix.  He plays Michael Jennings, a hotshot inventor who steals the ideas and properties of other corporations, and refines them for competitors. For legal reasons, Michael gets his mind wiped clean of the theft by a dangerous medical process that nearly boils his brain. This procedure also eliminates Michael's memory of the entire period he spent at work — all for a paycheck.  When a new, less dangerous procedure comes along — one that can safely do away with three years, instead of a few months — Michael is invited by an old friend to get involved in a project that could potentially change the world, and net Michael an eight-figure income. He will come out three years later with a larger bank balance and no idea of his accomplishments. It's here that the sleek, ascetic paranoia  that Dick triggered in his short story &quot;Paycheck&quot; surfaces: the invasion of the mind and soul. — Elvis Mitchell

This latest holiday literary adaptation from Miramax has the usual trappings of prestige — an award-winning novel as its source, a parade of top-notch filmmaking and acting talent — but it also has touches of intelligence and humor that separate it from such lifeless offerings as &quot;Chocolat&quot; and &quot;The Cider House Rules.&quot; Nicole Kidman, playing an over-civilized preacher's daughter stranded on a North Carolina farm during the Civil War, has never been lovelier. Her unfiltered movie-star charisma makes the character both irresistible and a little unbelievable. Jude Law is her long-lost lover, a Confederate soldier trudging homeward and meeting up with a procession of Hollywood hillbillies along the way. Anthony Minghella's dour seriousness is mitigated by his evident love of pageantry and spectacle, and the movie, in the best old Hollywood tradition, adds up to a mountain of honest corn. It's far from a great movie, but it has enough great-movie touches — lovely scenery, a richly layered soundtrack, a handful of diverting secondary performances (notably Renée Zellwegger, as Ruby, Ms. Kidman's no-nonsense backwoods helpmeet, and Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's wayward, fiddle-playing father), a pair of attractive stars — to make you wish it were one. — A.

The movie, adapted from a novel by Andre Dubus III, is the nearly flawed execution of a deeply flawed premise. The logic of the story seems to override the plausible motives of the characters, and you may feel the overwhelming force of the tragic ending without quite believing it.

But Mr. Jackson crushes any such fear. His &quot;King&quot; is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery. The final installment  follows the hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood), increasingly fevered as the ring exercises its power over him, on the last leg of his perilous journey to Mordor to destroy the sinister object.  The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), in a voice sodden with mellow sadness, believes that Frodo is on a suicide mission: &quot;There never was much hope. Just a false hope.&quot; Mr. Jackson takes his time with the story, but he's not sloughing off here. Rather he is building toward a more than solid conclusion. The grandiloquence that sustained the second installment, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; with its pounding and operatic martial fury — a movie that actually created a state of siege and left audiences hanging —  can be found here. By its end, &quot;King&quot; glides to the gentle bonhomie that opened the &quot;Ring&quot; movies, but its epilogue is tinged with regret: &quot;You can't go back.

After Harry suffers a heart attack in Erica's East Hampton beach house, she becomes his reluctant nurse, attracting the amorous attention of his doctor (Keanu Reeves). The film, a wry, knowing celebration of middle-age sexuality, is so funny in large part because it acknowledges the inevitability of hurt feelings.

Edward is a devoted teller of tall tales, which charms everyone except his son, Will (Billy Crudup), who must overcome this estrangement before his father's death. There is an interesting family drama hidden behind all the whimsy and moonshine, but the movie is so steadfast in its admiration for Edward and his inventions that it never considers that Will might have a point. The movie, in consequence, lacks one, as it wanders through a series of cute, fairy-tale episodes, featuring, among other things, a glass-eyed witch, a pair of conjoined Korean chanteuses, and a town where nobody wears shoes. Tim Burton's imagination, so wild and marvelous in movies like &quot;Pee Wee's Big Adventure,&quot; &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and &quot;Beetlejuice,&quot; seems to have been tamed. Rather than resonating with the uncanny magic of the unconscious, his images seem to be part of a strategy of denial, designed to obscure the possibility that Edward, a charismatic raconteur, might also be a narcissist and a compulsive liar. Will might forgive these lapses — that is a son's prerogative, after all. Far worse, from the audience's point of view, is that Edward is also a bit of a bore. — A. O. Scott"

His movie falls squarely into the realm of the previous Zwick bedeviled-hero films, &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; and &quot;The Siege.&quot; And I do mean squarely.  &quot;Samurai&quot; is a mythic western that combines a fish-out-of-water theme with an immersion in Japanese culture: John Ford's &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot; And this time, the can-do idol of millions, Tom Cruise, uses his polished chrome smile mirthlessly. The uneven &quot;Samurai&quot; is a can-do movie that's far more effective at communicating emotion in bigger scenes than in more intimate ones. Mr. Cruise plays the burnt-out former Army officer and Indian fighter Nathan Algren. He is hired by his former commander (Tony Goldwyn) who wants Algren to travel to Tokyo and train Japanese soldiers in the use of American tactics and rifles.  Algren is forced to send his nervous, underprepared imperial troops into battle too soon against an enemy of the Emperor, the samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). When a wounded Algren kills Katsumoto's second-in-command, he's captured by the invaders and, even more bewildering, cared for by Katusmoto's sister, Taka (Koyuki), the widow of the man Algren killed. Algren then learns the ways of the samurai with an alacrity that's expected of movie stars. — Elvis Mitchell"

That her dreams come true will come as no surprise; nor will the rather mild obstacles she faces. The story is crowded with incidents and subplots, but Ms. Alba's bland, self-confident perkiness keeps real emotional trouble at bay. Corny as it is, the movie is also a winning and warm-hearted celebration of upward mobility and civic responsibility, and the power of hip-hop to combine them. Mekhi Phifer plays Honey's love interest and neighborhood ally, and Lil' Romeo, showing real promise as an actor, plays a talented break-dancer whom Honey must save from the local drug dealer. The cameos by real-life rappers like Ginuwine and Missy Elliott, and the buoyant, beat-heavy soundtrack, give the movie an extra hit of vitality and glamour. — A. O. Scott"

The film isfar more a celebration of the Hubleyss work (and marriage) than a critical examination of it, stringing together interviews with the Hubleys culled from various archival sources and extensive clips from their films, including the Oscar-winning Moonbird of 1959.  With testimony from animation historians Charles Solomon and John Canemaker, the case is made that the Hubleys were among the first to liberate animation from pigs and bunnies, as John characterized the subject matter of studio cartoons, and introduce weighty themes such as overpopulation and the nuclear menace.

The light-fingered director Terry Zwigoff and the screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are just the guys for such a task. &quot;Bad Santa&quot; takes all of the Christmas season's bad vibes and converts them into an achingly funny and corrupt dark comedy. Billy Bob Thornton is Willie T. Stokes, a burned-out, hard-drinking safecracker who's annually roused from sleeping one off during the most wonderful time of the year by his dwarf partner, Marcus (Tony Cox). As Marcus works as a department store elf, he also cases the store so that he and Willie can break in and relieve the joint of valuable merchandise. On this tour, they've ended up in Phoenix, which just adds to the wealth of hilarious incongruity. As a director, Mr. Zwigoff has a taste for finding the dramatic power of self-loathing and making it entertainment. His previous films, the documentary &quot;Crumb&quot; and the his fiction-film debut &quot;Ghost World,&quot; both hinged on coping with epic tides of depression. &quot;Santa&quot; falls directly into that lineage. Mr. Thornton's face is drawn into a rictus of a snarl; his Willie anticipates trouble, and when it doesn't crop up on its own, he has to stir it up from the bottom of the pot.  Willie is filled with the most distorted kind of narcissism imaginable, and for Mr. Thornton, it functions as a kind of star chemistry. Willie ladles it generously on the kids who line up to see him on his wobbly perch on Santa's throne: he's the kind of minimum-wage offal who has sent his victims on to thousands of hours of therapy. —  Elvis Mitchell"

But instead, thanks to Jim  Sheridan's graceful, scrupulously sincere direction and the dry intelligence of his cast, &quot;In America&quot; is likely to pierce the defenses of all but the most dogmatically cynical viewers. The film, which Mr. Sheridan wrote with two of his daughters, is unabashedly personal, but he is too modest a filmmaker to turn his own experience into a lesson or a parable. From moment to moment, as it follows Johnny and Sarah Sullivan (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton, both quietly terrific) through their daily struggles, the story feels small, almost anecdotal. But just as its tactful realism is adorned with a dusting of magic, its unassuming clarity hides an unexpected grandeur. It is the kind of movie that keeps growing in your mind long after you ve seen it, and its characters are so radiantly particular that they come, after a while, to seem like people you know. — A. O.

Although that imagination has evidently been fed by sources as various as Betty Boop, Jacques Tati and European comic books, its products are too strange to be assimilated into any known tradition. The plot is too bizarre for summary, but it involves the efforts of a diminutive, club-footed grandmother to rescue her grandson, a Tour de France cyclist, from the clutches of the French mafia. Aiding her are her faithful dog, Bruno, and the Triplets of the title, a trio of weird sisters who subsist on a diet of frogs and who make entrancing music with kitchen appliances and old newspapers. The Triplets is a similar collage of the found and the invented. Its style evokes a post-war France making its stubborn, eccentric way into the modern world — a nation of cigarette-rolling truck drivers and accordion-squeezing pop singers. It is surely the oddest movie of the year — by turns sweet and sinister, insouciant and grotesque, invitingly funny and forbiddingly dark.

Amazingly, what it also seems to be saying is that 40 years after John Ford's 1956 &quot;The Searchers,&quot; we've arrived at a point in film history in which the movie industry can only offer a less sophisticated version of the same material. Overly sensitive and disdainful of her tough life, Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood) longs to escape the grim cabin she shares with her healer mother, Maggie (Cate Blanchett), and little sister, Dot (Jenna Boyd). Lilly gets away from home in a way she never bargained for — she's kidnapped by a group of renegade Indians who plan to sell her once they cross the border into Mexico. Just before Lilly is snatched away, Maggie's estranged father (Tommy Lee Jones) returns home: there's already tension in the household. When the worst happens, Maggie is forced to team with her father to track down her daughter. But &quot;The Missing&quot; leaves out the sexual paranoia that John Wayne's face reflected; he was eaten alive by the possibility that his abducted niece had become sexually involved with her captors. Despite torrents of brutality, there's no danger of rape from the scrupulous villains in &quot;The Missing.&quot; As a result, this is a movie that only exists from the shoulders up. It's an intriguing way for Ron Howard to play to his chief strength — and interests — the knotty and peculiar emotional cross-currents that buffet a family. And  for a time, before it shifts into the thriller aspect of the story, &quot;The Missing&quot; feels like a thoughtful attempt to focus on the strains of home life.   After the mission of &quot;The Missing&quot; begins, however, the movie starts to feel like an episode of Stephen King's &quot;Little House on the Prairie.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell"

The price of the popcorn-and drink combo at most theaters running this film is scarier. The titular entity is occupied by a ghost, Edward Gracey (Nathaniel Parker), who took his own life centuries ago in response to his lady love's suicide. Years later, the realtor Jim Evers (Mr. Murphy) is summoned to Gracey Manor with his wife, Sara (Marsha Thomason); tough-girl daughter, Megan (Aree Davis); and son, Michael (Marc John Jeffries). And the breathtaking Sara has an amazing resemblance to the late lady of the manor. &quot;Mansion&quot; is a movie that doesn't really want to evoke reaction - it lacks even the cheesy fear quotient that a film like &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy&quot; could dredge up.

Mr. Crowe plays Jack Aubrey, captain of the H.M.S. Surprise, a British frigate doing battle with a mysterious French battle ship off the Coast of South America. The combat scenes are shot with economy and vigor, but the most thrilling parts of the movie take place between skirmishes, when the complex system of authority and deference that runs the Surprise —  and the personality traits needed to keep it running —  is at the center of attention. The film's theme is the nature of authority, and Aubrey functions as a kind of ideal CEO: charismatic, tactically astute and able to instill in his sailors a sense of discipline and respect. Paul Bettany plays the ship's surgeon, Aubrey's best friend and foil, and the tension between them — between reason and duty, between intellect and action — gives the movie some unexpected dramatic depth. — A.

Directed in relatively mellow, easy-going style by Jon Favreau, &quot;Elf&quot; is a charming, silly family Christmas movie more likely to spread real joy than migraine, indigestion and sugar shock. The movie succeeds because it at once restrains its sticky, gooey good cheer and wildly overdoes it. The restraint comes from the casting of two beloved old sitcom curmudgeons, Ed Asner and Mr. Newhart, as Santa and his chief Elf.

Keanu Reeves, perhaps worried that he was showing too much range, has purged himself of all expression apart from a worried frown and a sorrowful grimace, which is mirrored in the face of Carrie-Anne Moss, who returns as Trinity. The salient distinction of the human remnants in Zion, apart from their earth-toned natural-fiber fashions, has been the capacity for love, a word much spoken in this movie. But their ranks, in spite of the presence of fine actors like Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Harold Perrineau, become more robotic with every passing scene. The sole exception is Jada Pinkett Smith as the daredevil pilot Niobe, who brings a touch of bad-girl B-movie attitude into the humorless subterranean gloom.

What starts out as a sharp workplace comedy gradually darkens into a kind of managerial film noir as Glass (played with a perfect mixture of creepiness and charm by Hayden Christensen) is pursued by Charles Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), the magazine's editor and, in this version at least, the savior of its honor.

The absurdist  movie, which is all plot and no plot at the same time, is a broad spoof of so-called  women's pictures from the 1940's through the 60's.

The problem is that the source, Philip Roth's 2000 novel, is not especially sober or scrupulous: it is an angry, ungainly squall of a book, a clamorous defense of sexual vitality in an age of Puritan censoriousness and a lyrical inquiry into the mysteries of race, old age and recent American history. As Coleman Silk, a Classics professor chased from his job after being absurdly accused of racism, Anthony Hopkins has a loose, mellow exuberance that almost persuades you to overlook a basic, insurmountable improbability, namely that his character is a black man who has spent most of his adulthood passing for white. Nicole Kidman, playing Coleman's abused, impoverished and much younger lover, is almost as hard to believe, but her performance is nonetheless serious and unaffected. Some of the best work comes in smaller parts: Wentworth Miller as young Coleman; Anna Deavere Smith as his mother; and especially Jacinda Barrett as the great love of his youth. The movie has many memorable, moving scenes — as well as a few awkward and embarrassing ones — but it never coheres either dramatically or intellectually, largely because it lacks a way to approximate the novel's unifying force, which is Mr. Roth s unruly, passionate and brilliant voice. — A.

He survives his ordeal but resolves to make a film about it, which brings him into contact with the elder sister's illegitimate daughter (Maria Cina), an actress blissfully unaware of her heritage.  The situation is creepy enough, but the screenplay, written by Mr. Hancock's wife and frequent collaborator, Dorothy Tristan, has trouble transforming the premise into genuine suspense.

No amount of misguided effort is going to help. It's an easy picture to ridicule; after a while, you almost feel as if the stars are making fun of the movie. Or at least, you'll wish Angelina Jolie — with her radiant presence and Panavision lips — and Clive Owen, with his brisk, existentialist cool were smart enough to do so. After the &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; movies, with their globe-trotting superficiality and numbing imbecility, Ms. Jolie must feel she owes her fans something serious. Unfortunately, she's starring in a movie even more benumbed and superficial, a liberal video game that demeans the very refugees it tries to spotlight. Her good-heartedness is probably the reason she chose to star in this film about a shallow young woman, Sarah Jordan, who's shaken out of her insular existence by the dashing Dr. Nick Callahan (Mr. Owen). &quot;Borders&quot; wants to dramatize the chasm between Sarah and Nick, whose impatient compassion endangers as many refugees as it saves. That metaphorical land mass is supposed to be her middle-class naiveté and his brooding, no-nonsense altruism. But they're much closer than they think — a pair of noble idiots. Inspired by his example, she raises money and follows him with medical supplies and food to Ethiopia. He repays her kindness with blithe cruelty. They finally tryst; the sweat beads seductively on their skins, while their glamorously gaunt jawlines expel plumes of cigarette smoke. This is a movie so oblivious that Martin Campbell, an accomplished action filmmaker, forgot that in the 1940's &quot;Casablanca&quot; had the good sense to have Rick note that the troubles of two people don't amount to a hill of beans. &quot;Borders&quot; is reminiscent of another 40's classic, the smashingly absurd &quot;Duel in the Sun,&quot; and is as realistic as a recent film based on real incidents: the remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell"

The camera, as it surveys the grimy streets and cramped apartments of lower Manhattan, trembles as if it were running a fever, and Dion Beebe's cinematography is jumpy and bleary-eyed. Meg Ryan, who has darkened her hair and suppressed all of her characteristic perkiness, plays Frannie, a writing teacher whose feverish love affair with a homicide detective (Mark Ruffalo) involves her in the search for a serial killer. The movie's association of female sexuality with mortal risk is potentially interesting, but the cooked-up, conventional serial killer plot smothers its suggestive nuances and makes the psychology of the two main characters, which might have been provocatively mysterious, seem as deliberately smudged as the film's visual style. — A.

It's the aftermath. The actors playing the characters who have been rocked by catastrophe don't sink to theatrical histrionics; instead they're linked by the red-eyed, unblinking stare of zombies, and they shamble through their day-by-day activities as if saddled with death wishes they are too enervated to act upon. This is American Existentialism. The stars achieve something that doesn't sound as if it's possible: a virtuosity in the depiction of people wasting away minute by minute. Be prepared for it. You won't come out unaffected, because the depths of intimacy that the director plumbs here are so rarely touched by filmmakers that &quot;21 Grams&quot; is tantamount to the discovery of a new country. Prof. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is suffering from a damaged heart, which is about to give out on him, and the transplant he receives so consumes him with guilt that he's like a death-row prisoner with a horrible secret who's been pardoned. He still believes he deserves to die. Cristina (Naomi Watts), a reformed party girl, has returned to her fallen ways after taking up with Paul. She's lost her family in an auto accident. And Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is a shaggy, trembling mountain of anger he can barely contain. His already tenuous grasp on sobriety is slipping away even faster since being involved in a terrible incident. Working with the screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and the bewilderingly versatile cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto — the team he assembled for his debut feature, &quot;Amores Perros&quot; — Mr. González Iñárritu once again deals with three scenarios connected by one far-reaching cataclysm. It's too early to call it a crowning work of a career — this is only his second film — but it may well be the crowning work of this year. — Elvis Mitchell"

The movie is crammed with vintage photos and film  clips of Mr. Bingenheimer escorting beautiful girls and celebrities into his so-called  English disco, the tiny Los Angeles club he established during the heyday of British  glam-rock. Hollywood is well stocked with oddballs like Mr. Bingenheimer who glean  their self-worth from access to celebrity.

Rémy (Rémy Girard) is dying of cancer, and friends, former lovers and his estranged wife gather around his death bed for a long, sentimental seminar replete with naughty jokes and wistful nostalgia. Joining them are two members of the younger generation, Rémy's son, Sébastien (Stéphane Rousseau), a wealthy international banker, and Nathalie (Marie-Josée Crozee), a heroin addict, who lack both the bravado and the narcissism of their parents. What makes this more than a facile study in generational conflict is Mr. Arcand's acute sense of history: he has made the cultural contradictions of global capitalism into the material of a heartfelt domestic drama that is also a broad, accessible and devilishly funny sex farce. — A.

Christine Jeff's film is relatively even-handed in its treatment of Hughes (Daniel Craig) and turns its subject from a case study in literary pathology into the heroine of a modern literary opera. The film, shot in dark, over-saturated colors by John Toon, is itself oversaturated with feeling. Rather than try to explain Plath s death, or probe the roots of her poetry, Ms. Jeffs and Gwenyth Paltrow burrow deep into her personality, leaving its essential, unsettling mysteries intact. Ms. Paltrow is a vivid, passionate presence throughout the film — she is rarely off the screen — and she charts the jagged course of Plath's abbreviated adulthood with ardor and intelligence. The movie turns biography into melodrama, but it does so out of a fierce, fascinated loyalty to Plath, who after all did much the same thing in her best poems. — A. O. Scott"

It is, instead, a long march to the slaughterhouse that seems to take forever to get going and, once it does, goes nowhere that hasn't been visited before by more talented filmmakers.  The plot, such as it is, kicks in when a van full of early 70's hippies stumbles into the remote farmhouse owned by the Hooper clan — crazed rednecks who, in the original version, represented a nightmare vision of Richard Nixon's Middle America, but who here represent little other than stereotypes in the service of sadism.

Yet, something feels familiar about the picture — Mr. Hackman has played this grubby-souled, hand-tailored heart of modern corruption before, and in a previous Grisham adaptation: &quot;The Firm.&quot; This time, he's a slick jury consultant named Rankin Fitch who employs ruthless tactics to empanel a jury that will best service his client. And like &quot;The Firm,&quot; the schematic crassness of the narrative provides an actor the opportunity to deliver some fine work. John Cusack gives one of his wiliest performances in some time, and one of his most adult, as the aging slacker who is drafted into jury duty. Apparently, the writers realize there's not much to be done with the boilerplate narrative, which involves the machinations of  the jury that Fitch is laboring to bend to his own will.

Unfortunately, those end titles, and the ones at the beginning, are the most informative portions of the film, as well as the most powerful. What comes between them is a flat-footed, overwrought crusader-against-evil melodrama, in which Cate Blanchett's formidable gifts as an actress are reduced to a haircut and an accent. Her Veronica Guerin bravely mocks and harasses various thugs and lowlifes, and consoles her worried co-workers and family members, but the movie is devoid of both dramatic intensity and genuine emotion.

The title comes from the British director Alan Clarke's 1989 rough-and-ready short film of the same name, a tough and dense look at the   violence in northern Ireland, which also didn't paste answers onto the  problem. Mr. Clarke's short outraged or absorbed viewers in the way Mr. Van  Sant's movie, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, is likely to do. (Mr. Clarke's title referred to the aphorism about the elephant in the living room — a problem that people refuse to face for so long that they are no longer even able to  see it.) &quot;Elephant&quot; will confound audiences looking for solutions or villains, because it doesn't supply them. There's no narrator perched  omnisciently over the events, nor the kinds of exaggerated melodramatics  and pop music that teen movies employ to insistently nag at emotions. There are few recognizable actors, since Mr. Van Sant populated the movie with   kids who had never acted before, heightening the realism and the tension. Mr. Van Sant gives &quot;Elephant&quot; a Spartan yet elusive life by shifting the film's focus from one group of  students to another; the camera actually drifts like a bored high school student.  And by the end of the movie, we realize where much of the power and clarity of the film comes  from. By making the camera an observer, we get a perspective  that often comes out of horror movies, a choice that whips the ordinary  with the terrifying —  an unforgettable mix. — Elvis Mitchell"

This time the good work comes from George Clooney. His gift of gab is perfectly suited for Miles, the crème de la crème of divorce lawyers. Miles has everything but a soul, though he doesn't actually look as if he'd require one. And the babe he falls for isn't exactly the person to give him one either. Marilyn (Catherine  Zeta-Jones), as delectable as a white-chocolate Easter Bunny, has been tagged for a vicious divorce by her husband, a serial adulterer, after she catches him cheating. Her uptown-girl beauty and silken opacity make her the kind of trophy Miles would want to win. And when she jabs a No. 2 pencil into Miles's heart by showing up with her beau, a Texas millionaire (Billy Bob Thornton), Miles is horrified, but not defeated.

Also evident is his obsession with Uma Thurman: by far the most emotionally charged relationship in the movie is the one between the director and his star, who functions as his muse, idol, alter ego and fetish object. Her character, the Bride, is a former assassin whose former lover (that would be Bill) tried to kill her on her wedding day. In this film, the first installment in a two-part revenge epic, the Bride wakes up from a 4-year coma and goes after the hired swords and guns who attacked her. Most of the exposition has been left for Volume Two; this one is an anthology of increasingly violent sequences, some sickening, some rather thrilling, that culminates in a Tokyo nightclub bloodbath  during which Lucy Liu, playing a petite yakuza boss, shows off her Japanese, and also (quite literally) her brains. — A.

Mr. von Trier is a ruthless provocateur with the sensibility of a practical joker. The ensemble drama, filmed on a stage designed as a map, often suggests a long-winded Brechtian deconstruction of &quot;Our Town.&quot; As a  contemptuous, nose-thumbing expression of the director's misanthropy, especially his  anti-Americanism, the movie is relentlessly true to its hateful vision, which portrays the  ideal of embracing human community (and especially the cozy, cookie-baking dream of  small-town America) as a lie. The only true solidarity to be found in any group, it  proposes, is in xenophobic mob violence. Set during the Depression in the imaginary American town of Dogville, it reworks Mr. von Trier's favorite metaphor for human cruelty — the persecution and martyrdom of an innocent young woman (played by Ms. Kidman) — then subjects it to a transcendently nasty, vengeful twist. — Stephen Holden"

Tom McCarthy has such an appreciation for quiet that it occupies the same space as a character in this film, a delicate, thoughtful and often hilarious take on loneliness.  Fin, with his low, rational voice and intense stare, has moved into the small spot after he inherits it. Mr. McCarthy treats Fin's new life as if his protagonist were emerging from underwater and must adjust to the onrush of aural assault. Much of it comes from Joe (Bobby Cannavale), the relentlessly friendly and talky Cuban who pulls up every day in his food truck to run what must be the loneliest retail location not staffed by a Maytag salesman. Hawking coffee and fanning up a cloud of busy, pushy and likable chatter, Joe elbows his way into the taciturn Fin's life. Mr. McCarthy wrings contrasts from the serene, diminutive Mr. Dinklage — whose dignity seems unassailable until finally ruffled, when he lets loose a thunderbolt of hostility — and the big, buffed Cannavale, whose unremitting volubility is sheer charm. Their relationship is goofily enthralling. A movie about a dwarf certainly flirts with being cringe-worthy, at least in the abstract, but Mr. McCarthy deals with his creations as characters. What's most important about Fin is the detachment he imposes on himself — his resignation with loneliness. — Elvis Mitchell"

Set in working-class Irish Catholic Boston, this film revisits the themes of violence, honor and guilt that have haunted many of Mr. Eastwood's movies; it is among the most humane of his films, but also the most rigorously pessimistic. Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn play Dave, Sean and Jimmy, boyhood friends who must revisit the traumas of their youth when Jimmy's daughter is murdered. Sean and his partner (Laurence Fishburne) must investigate the killing, which it appears Dave may have committed. The performances are first rate. Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, Celeste, and Laura Linney, as her cousin Annabeth, who is married to Jimmy, expand the film's emotional compass, allowing us to see how grief ripples through families and communities.

The crime was notable for its brutality, and also because it appeared to implicate John Holmes, the legendary porn star who knew the victims. In reconstructing the crime, James Cox has made an aggressively stylish, blithely sleazy whodunit that might be described as &quot;Law and Order&quot; on crack. Val Kilmer, as Holmes, is antic, needy and occasionally charming, and the rest of the cast seems to enjoy the hyperactively scuzzy ambience of drugs, guns and classic rock. Lisa Kudrow, playing Holmes's estranged wife, Sharon, stands out from the rest. Her severity and restraint, and the opacity of her motives, make her the only interesting character in a movie that, while sometimes absorbing, ultimately feels pointless. — A. O. Scott"

Although it's briskly directed and enjoyably stylized, &quot;Out of Time&quot; is shallow —  actually empty. Mr. Washington, as the small-town Florida police chief Matt Lee Whitlock, steals several hundred thousand dollars in seized drug money to pay for the experimental cancer therapy his mistress Ann Merai (Sanaa Lathan) needs. But when she and her jealous husband, Chris (Dean Cain), die in a fire —  and all the money mysteriously disappears, while Matt is left the beneficiary of Ann Merai's million-dollar insurance policy —  the clues point to Matt as the murderer. To make matters worse, Matt's estranged detective wife, Alex (Eva Mendes), is investigating the case. To further crank up Matt's adrenaline level as he's looking for evidence to clear himself, the feds want the drug money —  now. Mr. Washington plays the desperation well; it becomes Matt's defining characteristic. And Carl Franklin keeps &quot;Time&quot; breezy enough to fight the oppressive humidity that his cast is obviously laboring under in the Florida sun by keeping the proceedings buoyant. By the time Matt is fighting to hang onto a rapidly crumbling hotel balcony while battling a suspect, you realize that a functioning sense of humor is the classiest touch that a filmmaker could lend to the piled-on plot. — Elvis Mitchell"

The story of self-discovery that Audrey Wells leads Frances, a writer, through is eminently superficial, though the director keeps the movie going with a steady, commanding hand. Ms. Lane initially gives Frances a calm and pleasant sunniness, though she is resigned to never finishing her book.  She's attending a book signing early in the movie when she learns of her husband's philandering. When her best friend gives Frances a ticket to Tuscany, she grabs it. The trip is supposed to be pressure-free for Frances — it's a gay tour of Italy. She finds a new love anyway: a villa, Bramasole, that she buys on the spur of the moment.  But Tuscany is not the soul-saver that Frances hopes for: the house's promises of romance and a new life in Italy don't burst into bloom like the sunflowers that are often in view. The lesson of &quot;Sun&quot; is that Frances needs to look closer at the big picture, and her avoidance of that raises questions about how perceptive a critic she must have been. Eventually, the movie feels Frances has suffered enough and slaps on a happy ending like a Post-it note, but it's not earned. — Elvis Mitchell"

As the film veers uncertainly between meticulous historical recapitulation  and shameless hokiness, it brings in enough characters to populate a mini-series.

The movie pits an elderly Elvis Presley and J.F.K., who's now an old African-American, against a mummy who shambles around a retirement home sucking the souls out of victims in a manner that probably explains why the picture got an R rating. The writer-director Don Corsarelli, faithfully working from a short story by Joe R. Lansdale, is moored in confines as limiting as the wheelchair the King uses to get around and a budget as starved of cash as Presley's movies were of imagination. The picture has a grungy high-spirit for its first third, and dissipates like a mist from an aerosol can by that point. When it requires that extra charge of magic or technique to lift it, the picture stalls out; finally, it's neither scary enough nor funny enough &#151; tramps like this, baby, they were born to be rented.  What fission the movie generates comes from its lead performers, including Ossie Davis's mocking, salted gravitas in playing J.F.K. &#151; here, he surgically went black and can't go back after the assassination attempt on his life.   Both of these living legends &#151; they're alive in this film, anyway &#151; are right out of the battle-ready episode of &quot;The Golden Girls.&quot; The movie is often enlivened by a cranky, wheels-off performance by Bruce Campbell as the King. Yet, &quot;Bubba H0-Tep&quot; falls back on the antic, self-consciously jokiness of a Mad magazine movie parody &#151; despite Mr. Campbell's performance, the movie winks at its pop-historical perspective so often it starts to feel like a twitch.

Jason Biggs, who is perhaps a little too amiable for the job, plays the Woody Allen surrogate, a comedy writer named Jerry Falk who is saddled with a difficult manager (Danny  DeVito) and an impossible girlfriend, a would-be actress named Amanda (Christina Ricci). Amanda, a sexual dynamo and a manipulative head case, might have been an exercise in sour misogyny, but Ms. Ricci has a feral intelligence that turns her into a finely drawn comic monster.

The digital video cinematography has unusual depth and luster, the action sequences are punchy and inventive, and the music is pretty good, too. Unfortunately, it seems as if the writing and directing, which Robert Rodriguez also did, were something of an afterthought. There are some witty moments, mostly courtesy of Johnny Depp, who plays a C.I.A. agent messing around in Mexico, and some high-impact many-gun salutes to the action auteurs Sergio Leone and John Woo. But the mood of tongue-in-cheek, romantic mayhem is spoiled by the picture's incoherence, and by its resort to appalling extremes of violence when nothing else is working. Salma Hayek appears only in flashback, as the hero's cruelly murdered true love. The present tense is devoted to an elaborate maze of double-crosses and vendettas involving a drug kingpin's attempt to overthrow the Mexican president — Scott"

This disease eating up her empathy and decency is what she picked up from the effortlessly cool Evie (Nikki Reed), who crashes into Tracy's life and plucks her from an existence of age-appropriate fixations like Barbie dolls. Evie, with the physical confidence of a much older girl, knows exactly how to devastate Tracy; she breezily drops hints that she thinks her new friend is immature. As Evie takes Tracy under her broken wing to remake her, we feel we're watching the protagonist of &quot;Thirteen&quot; undergo the initiations of a new tribe.  The closest  the film comes to a narrative is in following its young central figure straying into sex, drugs and alienation and her sudden detachment from her struggling single mother, Melanie (Holly  Hunter). What we recognize from the stricken look in Melanie's face is the same panic in Tracy's eyes — it's something mother and daughter share, and Ms. Hunter wills this spiritual match-up into existence. The movie has the ebb and flow that comes from material structured as a series of anecdotes —  it doesn't build, and sometimes it feels as cluttered as a 13-year-old's bedroom. But that may be a byproduct of Catherine Hardwicke's attempt to layer incidents that are as far as possible from the weary set of clichés that inform pictures about teens. Ms. Hardwicke, making her directorial debut, works from a screenplay she authored with Ms. Reed, shaped around autobiographical elements from the actress's own life. Usually, the protagonist is the bystander — in &quot;Thirteen,&quot; she's the fuse. — Elvis Mitchell"

The towering, action-packed logo is a further sardonic comment on the lack of activity in the protagonist's life. There's as much at stake in this hilarious, moody and cantankerous film adaptation of &quot;Splendor&quot; as there was in this summer's other movies of comics anti-heroes like &quot;The Hulk&quot; and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.&quot; Harvey is extraordinary — by the way, so is this movie. As played by Paul Giamatti, Harvey's a gray wad of anger that spends his time in his cave-like apartment, with shelves sagging under the weight of his collection of record albums and jazz 78's. And sputtering to his equally powerless pals about a world that he refuses to understand. Slumped into a posture that's a question mark with a pot-belly, Mr. Giamatti's a frustrated tremor, shaking and gesticulating futilely. The filmmakers use the real Mr. Pekar as a narrator initially. For a time, the film cuts to the real-life Pekar, fulminating onscreen with his friends against a stark-white background. This sounds like a mocking, distancing device — and in the wrong hands, it would be. But the real-life Pekar is as vivid in his way as Mr. Giamatti. The actual Pekaris a flinty crank spouting while the actors portraying figures from the streets of Cleveland chuckle in disbelief at him and his obsessive, nerdy friends, like Toby (played in the film with breath-taking precision by Judah Friedlander). The great cast also includes Earl Billings as Mr. Boats, one of Harvey bellicose, small-minded and larger-than-life co-workers, and Danny Hoch. Harvey's romantic match, Joyce Brabner, is played with a tart, intriguing directness by Hope Davis that's equal parts Emma Goldman and Olive Oyl —  that is, the Olive Oyl of the comics, not the screaming helpless No. 2 pencil of the cartoons. And the picture becomes something richer and fuller when Joyce enters the film. Harvey has someone to square off with, and her eccentricities complement his. — Elvis Mitchell"

The movie, which pits Freddy Krueger against Jason Voorhees, is far more horrible than horrifying. The only way that &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; might really be any fun is if these two avengers from beyond the grave decided to team up and go after the cast of  &quot;American Wedding.&quot; This dumb, only intermittently — sometimes even intentionally — funny sequel asks the question that since almost everything else from the 1980's has come back, why not the cynosures of the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series and the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; movies. But people are also nostalgic for the world of four television networks, Macaulay Culkin and anti-trust legislation, too  — that doesn't mean they're coming back. The smirky sauciness of Kreuger (Robert Englund) at least gives audiences something to root for, or against. The real problem is that Jason is a nobody whose face has been hidden from view for 20 years. There probably won't be a sequel to &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; — a concept that first surfaced over a decade ago, when both franchises had a trace of, well, blood, left. But if there is a next one, maybe they can get a make-over from the Fab Five of &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;; both Freddy and Jason are so last century. — Elvis Mitchell"

As an actor in other people's movies, Mr. Costner is at his best when he unleashes his raffish, reckless charm, letting the good man and the bad boy duke it out for pre-eminence. Under his own direction, though, his self-regarding piety always wins. Every pause, every gesture, every grimace is fraught with significance, so that even his cowboy reticence comes to seem like shameless showboating. Annette Bening's performance, unfortunately, is well matched to Mr. Costner's; if the two of them were any more upstanding they'd be trees. Some of the supporting actors, notably Robert Duvall and Michael Jeter, throw off a few sparks of levity, but neither they nor the well-executed final shootout can prevent the movie from suffocating in its earnest self-seriousness. — A.

The foreign crime boss Alex Martel (Olivier Martinez) is about to be extradited after leaving a trail of corpses and misery.

The picture  —  a drab, talky amalgam of &quot;Rain Man,&quot; &quot;Prizzi's Honor&quot; and &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; — is mostly dull and shapeless. But the torpor is leavened by some howlingly awful sexual repartee, and by the brief appearances of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, called in as designated over-actors, and who are at least bad on purpose. — A.

The voiceover narration by David McCullough, and the Ken Burns-style archival stills give it an air of public television worthiness that undercuts the excitement of the racing sequences. The story, of a runty, crooked-legged horse who became the biggest media celebrity in Depression-weary America, is impossible not to embrace, and Mr. Ross tells it with efficiency and professionalism. The movie is successful —  it gives you a sense of the times, and of the colorful human characters whose lives were entwined with Seabiscuit's — but it is also disappointing. The cast includes some of the finest actors working in movies today, but with the partial exception of Chris Cooper (as the horse's enigmatic, taciturn trainer), they are confined by the film's schematic, simplified storytelling. Jeff Bridges, as Charles Howard, Seabiscuit's owner, and Tobey Maguire, who plays his principal jockey, the unlucky Red Pollard, are both thoroughbreds.

It begins with Lucía narrating; she is about to board a plane with her husband, Ramón, for a Brazilian vacation. He disappears with the tickets as the flight is being announced. After the initial shock of her husband's broad-daylight vanishing wears off, she's forced to recognize that her marriage hadn't been a particularly happy one for some time. Ms. Roth's radiance and understanding of Lucía's emotional life gives this movie a touch of necessary psychological accessibility. Movies of this subgenre, in which the protagonist has to come to an understanding of herself by measuring her own life against her previous somnolent bourgeoisie existence, can feel vapid. This is partially because the star has to awaken from her own passivity before our very eyes. Ms. Roth makes Lucía's state a willful ignorance instead, and her emerging recognition of her unhappiness, as new information comes to light, adds a dimension to the material. The film also has two able, love-struck neighbors who lend her a couple of hands: Félix (Carlos Alvarez Novoa) &#151; a battered and elderly former political firebrand who still has a bit of a fuse left &#151; and Adrián (Kuno Becker), a 20-ish musician determined to prove his seriousness by quoting dense philosophical precepts at the most inopportune moments. Mr. Serrano stages his wobbly adaptation of Rosa Montero's novel &quot;La Hija del Canibal&quot; with lively, fast-moving efficiency.

They are a forgotten population struggling to bring in enough income so that they don't become disposable. They're expendable manpower in the war to man the desks, mops and bottom-drawer duties of the behind-the-scenes world of luxury hotels, where they're unnoticed by the public, and underpaid and overworked by their employers. This is an urban-legend horror story rendered with grim intelligence by the man with the right tools for the job: Stephen Frears. This understated and sure film is set in a world of survivors. One of them, the Nigerian Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) — who drives a cab and also works as a hotel porter under the large thumb of the smooth operator night manager, Sneaky, a smooth operator (Sergi Lopez) — seems to be as haunted as he is obsessed. The film doesn't elaborate on the troubles that have sent Okwe so far from home; all we really know is that he has left a wife and a daughter behind, and part of his pain comes from pining for them. That lingering misery is what keeps him safely on the couch of his Turkish roommate, the virginal Senay (Audrey Tatou), refusing to act on the magnetism that keeps her gazing at him adoringly. He's capable of loyalty to the rest of his ad hoc family —  to Guo Yi (Benedict Wong), the mortuary attendant, and the dangerously close-to-cliché, lovable hooker (Sophie Okonedo). The actress's cleverness brings shading and warmth to an otherwise stereotyped part. &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; suggests a demented sequel to Paul Mazursky's &quot;Moscow on the Hudson,&quot; a dog-eared fairy tale in which industry and hard work could deliver refugees from evil, or at least into the middle classes.

Afterward, you feel more beaten up than exhilarated, but the cast at least seems to be having some fun.

One of them, the only child left in the local orphanage, dreams that a band of angels has come to town, and he tries to persuade them to take him away with them. At least this is what seems to be happening. But the film declines to mark a clear boundary between dream and reality; instead it unfurls a series of overlapping, enigmatic stories into a quilt of homegrown surrealism and soft-focus spirituality.

Convened to battle a world-threatening evil, the league is a group of tough, forgotten or ignored British loners brought together at the behest of the. The group is led by the legendary but aged hunter and explorer Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery), who, though well past his prime, is still capable of some world-beating moves.

Mr. Norrington shows glimmers of faith in Mr. Moore's melancholic and apocalyptic vision. Still, the movie suffers from its own anxiety: a dread of being too literate, if not too literary.

In the case of Gore Verbinski's film, the answer is sure. Mr. Verbinski's penchant for logistics combined with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's desire to spend like a drunken pirate when it comes to putting everything onscreen melt into an often frenetic, colorful and entertaining comic adventure. The dazzling, high-flying silliness is quite an achievement:  the movie is better than it deserves to be, given its origins. In fact, there's enough storyline for several movies. The wiry and beauteous tomboy Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) owns a medallion that gets the plot going roughly a scant hour into &quot;Pirates.&quot; The pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Elizabeth because of the medallion, which turns out to be an enchanted piece of gold that can free Barbossa and his swabbies from their curse. They're the larcenous undead whose skeletons can be seen in the moonlight. But the movie belongs to Johnny Depp as the pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow. Gargling his consonants before spitting them out, Mr. Depp suggests a man who has spent either a great deal of time with Keith Richards after a tour of the Rebel Yell factory, or a man who has spent a great deal of time watching Mike Myers do his Keith Richards impression. — Elvis Mitchell"

And old jokes is really what &quot;Blonde 2&quot; is all about. Reese Witherspoon returns as Elle Woods, the indefatigable sprig of a girl whose disposition is as sunshiny as her hair. Previously, she conquered Harvard Law School, a venue in need of a new world order, and in the nominal sequel, she takes on the moribund legislative branch in Washington. Elle is working as an aide to Representative Rudd (Sally Field), a fellow Delta Nu. Probably the funniest thing in the picture is seeing these Oscar-sized forces of nature: Ms. Witherspoon, the most determined actress of the 21st century, is posed pert nose-to-nose with Ms. Field, whose blurted &quot;You really like me&quot; sentiment disguised a will equally steely. But Charles Herman-Wurmfeld and the writer Kate Kondell don't make enough of this match-up. Instead, &quot;Blonde 2&quot; is repetitive rather than reiterative, going over the same material as the first. The snappy, happy Elle is ridiculed by Rudd's worldly and world-weary aides, especially the tough, crude Grace (Regina King). So, Elle has to wear them down, win them over, yet still find time to get married.

To invoke the name of another underwhelming new film, &quot;Sinbad&quot; is legally bland. It stars Brad Pitt, who's such an actual avatar of golden-haired perfection that he's more credible as a cartoon; his under-inflected, slightly toasted-sounded arrogance seems less than fitting for a lusty, robust hero and con man and more in line with the stoner he played in &quot;True Romance.&quot; As it stands, kids will gravitate more toward his antic, commanding and inventive sidekick pooch. Or toward Eris, the capricious god of Chaos (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose need to stir up trouble isn't quite as grandiose as &quot;Sinbad&quot; requires. As Sinbad sails the film's marvelous computer-rendered seven seas on his mission, Eris conjures mischief. She's the otherworldly presence looming over the titular figure's peregrinations, and her mellifluous malevolence is one of the most distinctive elements the picture has to offer.

The movie is suitably graphic and terrifying, but it also has some surprising pastoral moments, as the main characters flee London for the countryside. Anthony Dod Mantle's digital cinematography has an exquisite, painterly beauty that makes the picture not just scary, which it surely is, but genuinely haunting.

The idea that McG and the screenwriters use to inform the picture with an abiding sweetness is to treat the Angels like a family. But what carries more weight than any threat to the world — which they can overcome with one hand tucked into a thong behind their backs — is a peril to the bonds that hold the Angels together. And in &quot;Throttle,&quot; there are three looming dangers to Charlie's brood: one is the retired Angel-gone-renegade Madison Lee (Demi Moore), who's saddled with the traditional threat to national security. Another is Dylan's former lover, the Irish mob leader Seamus O'Grady (Justin Theroux).

(As the angry green fellow hops through the desert, pursued by fighter jets, he looks more Claymation than computer-generated, and you half expect to see Wallace and Gromit in the cockpits.) Nor is it the witless writing or the hectic, inconsistent acting. Eric Bana's inertia is overcompensated by the trembling weepiness of Jennifer Connelly, who plays his soul mate, and the raving of Nick Nolte, as his dad, a mad scientist. These lapses would be forgivable if the filmmakers had found the right tone of pop seriousness to bring the hero and his story into focus. They seem to be at once taking the material too seriously and condescending to it, and they are too busy marveling at their own technique to make us care about the sufferings of the Hulk, who is finally not credible at all. — A.

And though the ever-deepening story takes its name from Edith Hahn-Beer's autobiographical 1999 book, &quot;The Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust,'' questions of identity - and the continual submersion of self to stay alive - are the heart of the story. &quot;Edith Hahn willed herself to disappear,'' says the narrator, Susan Sarandon. It is a bewitching and harrowing tale, told by the woman who survived the impostures in which she cloaked herself. The narrative has the engrossing folds and twists of a novel. Hahn-Beer loses her true love to cowardice, her mother to the Nazis. Years later, she gains a family of her own, after assuming the identity of an Aryan she knew years earlier. She burrows so completely into this falsehood that she marries a kind German, who's also a Nazi sympathizer. (By the end of the war, he's drafted and she takes on the absurd and frightening position of the title of her book.) And she so deeply sublimates her feisty, fiery personality in playing the role of a compliant wife that she comes to love her second existence. Finally, what threatens to become a life sentence of self-abnegation is commuted because the man who loved Hahn-Beer and abandoned her earlier persuaded the young woman into hiding her real identity papers in the lining of a book. Despite the dramatic sweep of her life, the actual threat of extermination for Hahn-Beer, a law student in her late 20's who endured in Nazi Germany by secreting away much of herself, gives the movie a grave, transfixing air of real-life existentialism. — Elvis Mitchell"

Unlike such gaudy, gleaming toys, in which the hoods have access to so many devices and fleets of automobiles that you wonder why they couldn't just retire on what they're spending on pulling off the crimes, the Australian-based film is set in a trough of despair. It features a few tart rip-off scenes and a performance of back-alley bravura by Guy Pearce in the lead as Dale, the thinking-man's hood who is the oldest of the Twentyman brothers, three accomplished thieves who are just about to be set free on bail. Their lawyer, the scheming, perfectly exfoliated Frank (Robert Taylor), who's arranging their release, has also set up a bank job for them and turns against them by its end. The rest of the film involves the brothers' getting pulled into another robbery after getting out of the joint, and using it to plot their comeback. &quot;The Hard Word&quot; is a series of snatches and betrayals, with a couple of surprises that aren't terribly hard to figure out.

Essentially, that's what &quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot; is all about, the American middle-class obsession of documenting innocuous daily life with eight-millimeter cameras and now videotape. Mr. Jarecki took film of a continuing tragedy and shrewdly wove the footage into a grim, watchable wormhole narrative about a family's decades-long tumble into a shattering pile of self-denial, lies and abuse. In the case of the Friedman family of Great Neck, on Long Island, the videotapes and eight-millimeter films say plenty. The amiable, deep bond between father and sons is tested when a child pornography scandal rocks their homes and lives. Mr. Jarceki so recognizes the archetypal figures in the Friedman home that he knows to push things any further through heavy-handed assessment would be redundant. This translates into an astonishing amount of confidence in his judgment. He layers the story, setting up his premise early in the film — that first impressions can't be trusted and that truth rests with each person telling the story. — Elvis Mitchell"

The mentor Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the virtual villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) also return, and a whole new group of characters surface as Neo, his lover, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and the crew continue to fight the oppressive forces threatening to eliminate humanity and the hidden city of Zion. As the middle film of a trilogy, &quot;Reloaded&quot; seeks to increase the emotional stakes — which it doesn't quite accomplish — while leaving enough of a cliffhanger that audiences will be bedeviled enough to flock back into the tents for the last portion.

This one unfolds in a fairy-tale 1962 Manhattan, its streets thronged with boxy cabs and impossibly stylish dressers. What is missing, though, is the subtext of sexual and social panic that made the earlier movies so bracing in their silliness. Ms. Zellweger's proto-feminist firebrand, an apostle of sex without love and workplace equality, tangles with Mr. McGregor's playboy journalist, with matrimony the foreordained result. David Hyde-Pierce and Sarah Paulson are the neurotic second couple, and the romantic high jinks are fairly well managed.

For all the film's antiseptic, sitcom qualities, it does touch on some significant moral and behavioral issues, just like the Disney serials most parents will remember (&quot;Spin and Marty,&quot; etc.), though tempered by the 21st-century notion that shopping is the best solution to any kind of psychological stress.

Mr. Malkovich proves his devotion to actors, lingering on them during moments of silence. And the movie echoes its director's own deportment as an actor, alternating silky smoothness with burlap coarseness. The lawyer-turned-police-officer Agustin Rejas (Javier Bardem) is tracking down a pack of guerrillas, led by the man known as Ezequiel. Ezequiel's career traces the same steps as Abimael Guzman, the philosophy professor turned leader of Peru's murderous Shining Path terrorist collective, right down to his capture. Determined, solicitous and calm, Rejas goes about his job, sifting through the wreckage — physical and emotional — left in Ezequiel's wake. Mr. Bardem plays Rejas with a morose wit, a cheekiness that registers almost as an afterthought. He exudes a weary professionalism because his manner is the only tool that keeps him from being subsumed by depression. Mr. Bardem's performance is different from anything he's done before — the vivacious Reinaldo Arenas of &quot;Before Night Falls,&quot; the brooding paraplegic of &quot;Live Flesh&quot; — characters who couldn't hide the tremors of emotion that rocked them to the very core.

His best material is autobiographical, like his assessment of Holy-Roller church services: &quot;Church is a concert for old people who don't get out too much.&quot; (The high-firepower profanity of his act will probably send quite a few people to church.)

The sniper, who calls Stu on the phone and issues instructions that have to be followed to the letter (or else!), is a sneering omniscient moralist who coerces his victim into breaking down and confessing his sins, which turn out to be quite petty.

But in the case of Nathaniel Kahn, the illegitimate son of the great architect Louis I. Kahn, who died  in 1974, that poignancy has an extra twinge, since this mostly absent father strove so diligently to remain a man of mystery. When Kahn collapsed and died of a heart attack in the men's room at Pennsylvania Station, he had been deemed by some to be the greatest living American architect, but his body remained unidentified for two days. At his death he was hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Nathaniel Kahn was 11 at the time, and the personal documentary he has made, &quot;My Architect,&quot; is a record of his quest to put together the pieces of his father's compartmentalized life. Kahn, it turned out, juggled three families for many years, one official and two not.

In Peter Sollett's delicate and altogether satisfying romantic comedy, it's Victor's puffed-rice pride that always gets him into trouble. Pride is a tricky subject to make a film about. Part of what will leave you taking in all of the delights of &quot;Vargas&quot; with open-mouthed wonder comes from the director's surefooted navigating of the way pride bounces around a small, packed household. Victor lives in a tiny apartment with his family, including his stubborn, salt-of-the-earth grandmother (Altagracia Guzman).

After stripping off their civvies, they emerge from the phone booth a star. Christopher Reeve gave a breezy, farcical charge to Superman and Clark Kent. As Batman and his alter ego, the wastrel playboy Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton seemed to have a thousand things on his mind, most of them unpleasant. But poor Ben Affleck is lost in the minor, passable &quot;Daredevil,&quot; where he portrays the blind, red-costumed and horn-headed crime fighter whose other senses &#151; hearing, touch, taste &#151; were exaggerated in the chemical accident that cost him his sight.  A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role. Even his scarlet leather outfit makes him diminutive. The interlocked double D on his left breast makes him look like part of the food-service industry: &quot;Hi, I'm Daredevil, and I'll be your superhero this evening.&quot; &#151; Elvis Mitchell

With relentless clarity, Mr. Polanski tracks the deterioration of his hero's situation and the day-in, day-out assault on his humanity. There are scenes of unwatchable brutality as well as of kindness and solidarity, but what is most remarkable is the sense of daily life in impossible conditions.

A recent — very recent — decision to have an American actor, Breckin Meyer, voice the lead instead of Mr. Benigni, who also stars as Pinocchio and was a co-writer of the screenplay, leaves you with the impression that Mr. Meyer was actually in the projection booth reading the script. That might account for the quality of the voice-overs, which are so sloppy you might feel as if you're watching a 1978 Hong Kong action picture: the dubbed mouths of the Italian cast are probably still moving an hour after the film is over.

As has happened before with this director's films, the fairly conventional story — a revenger's tragedy pitting a young Irish immigrant (Leonardo DiCaprio) against his father's killer, a nativist warlord (Daniel Day-Lewis) — is less interesting than the setting. Mr. Day-Lewis gives his character, known as Bill the Butcher, an earthy Shakespearean grandeur. In his mouth, the rough vernacular of the old New York streets becomes poetry. If Mr. DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz (in the underimagined role of a spirited pickpocket) don't shed their movie-star auras, they do show themselves to be intrepid and engaging actors. But the real achievement of the movie is in the way it brings history to life — not merely by meticulously recreating its details, but by offering a troubling and timely interpretation of how the violence and iniquity of the past continues to ramify into the present. The film, flawed and indelible, is nothing less than an attempt to reimagine the germs of America's historical identity.

The film takes pains to portray that abuse (which involved racial insults) as belonging to a pattern of social dysfunction instilled in African-Americans by white slaveowners and passed down through the generations. — Stephen Holden

(Terence Blanchard's gorgeous score helps a lot.) Edward Norton, as Monty Brogan, the prison-bound dealer, has a scrappy, mercurial intelligence, and the work of the supporting cast (especially Brian Cox as Monty's father, a retired fireman; Rosario Dawson as Monty's girlfriend; and Barry Pepper as one of his childhood friends) is a reminder of how generous Mr. Lee can be with actors. The final sequence &#151; one of Mr. Lee's signature flights of invention in an otherwise naturalistic film &#151; is a crazy, moving evocation of the absurdity and tenacity of the American Dream. — A.

Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy manifests itself in a gripping, intense fashion in this second of the film adaptations. It may be the first sequel that does not bother to give a reprise of the major plot elements of its predecessor immediately; the plan is simply to drop us right into the action. This stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension, the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are experiencing on their journey. Their mission began in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, could begin the end of life on Middle Earth. The warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) has been inflated into an even more assured, reflexive action hero. He helps a bewitched king (Bernard Hill) defend his castle. The action sequences are even more compelling than the first time around; we could be watching Orson Welles's &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; as directed by George A. Romero — Shakespearean-scale bloodshed and loss as an exploitation movie.

The film tells the story of Father Amaro (Gael García Bernal), a dreamy-eyed 24-year-old cleric dispatched to a small parish church in Los Reyes to assist its aging priest, Father Benito (Sancho Gracia). What Father Amaro discovers is a corrupt church bureaucracy collaborating with local drug lords who donate huge sums of money to favorite church charities. In return the church hierarchy turns a blind eye to their activities. The scandalous nature of the movie has helped make it the highest-grossing home-grown film in Mexican history. Terrible things happen in &quot;El Crimen del Padre Amaro,&quot; but the movie ultimately has no tragic dimension. — Stephen Holden"

Salma Hayek plays the artist with more charisma than insight, and her scenes with Alfred Molina (who plays Diego Rivera, Kahlo's straying, devoted husband) are clunky and literal, but Ms. Taymor is a playful, inventive and emotionally astute filmmaker constrained (as her subject rarely was) by convention.

Madonna plays the spoiled wife of a pharmaceutical magnate (Bruce Greenwood) and Adriano Giannini, in a role originated by his father, Giancarlo, is the rough-hewn fisherman with whom she is stranded on a deserted Mediterranean island.

The inmates, all female, are the victims of a stringently moralistic brand of Irish Catholicism, now on the wane, that used to punish unmarried young women (many in their teens) for premarital sex.  These &quot;bad girls&quot; exiled from their families and communities were forced to do slave labor in convent laundries that proliferated in Ireland until recently. &quot;The Magdalene Sisters,&quot; which tells the semifictionalized stories of four young women in one convent, is set roughly from 1964 to 1969.   Most prison movies have a monster authority figure, and so does this film. Here that ogre is the head nun, Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), a twisted diabolical autocrat. In a brilliant performance, Ms. McEwan makes this character horribly believable by portraying her cruelty not as raw sadism but as righteous punishment dispensed by a religious fanatic with a warped sense of values. — Stephen Holden"

Since Duff is played by Tom Green, onetime MTV personality and onetime husband of Drew Barrymore, I'm inclined to agree, though I am aware that others will not. I still have a file of letters provoked by my lonely defense of &quot;Freddy Got Fingered,&quot; Mr. Green's feature-length test of audience patience and intestinal fortitude, released in the spring of 2001. While I stand helplessly by my judgment that the rubber-limbed, soft-spoken Canadian performer can be very funny, &quot;Stealing Harvard&quot; is, for the most part, nowhere near dumb enough to be brilliant. &#151; A.

There are also some aliens to contend with. M.

Mike Myers adds a dull fourth character, the villainous Goldmember, to a repertory that already includes Austin, Dr. Evil and Fat  Bastard. Michael Caine appears as Austin's suave, still-swinging father, the British  master spy Nigel Powers, and Beyonce Knowles of the pop group Destiny Child is a Pam Grier parody named Foxxy Cleopatra.

Since 1971, the Country Bears Jamboree has been a fixture of Disney World in Orlando, Fla., and clearly its down-home brand of ursine animatronic entertainment was crying out for adaptation into a big-screen feature.

A casual sexual encounter with her best friend (Bebe Neuwirth) over Thanksgiving break leads to an attempted cover-up that resembles a sophisticated French farce.

The role of the  spoiled family housecat Snowbell (Nathan Lane) has been beefed up, and Mr. Lane turns the  character's every peevish complaint into an amusing comic barb.

The screen adaptation of Chris Fuhrman's cult coming-of-age novel captures that age of embarrassment with an accuracy (and compassion) that eludes most Hollywood teen films. Kieran Culkin and Emile Hirsch are schoolmates, pranksters and collaborators on a comic book whose characters, including a monstrous caricature of their school's mother superior (Jodie Foster), are extensions of events and people in their lives.

Driving the plot is the tension between Sergeant Enders (Nicholas Cage) and Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), a young marine who is being trained along with other Navajos during World War II to transmit information from the battle front, because their native language is a code that cannot be broken by the Japanese. The picture invents an angle — kill the Navajos if they're captured, a battle condition of which there's no known record — and ignores the more compelling truth: that the Navajos are prevented from being active participants in the same war in which Native Americans raised the flag at Iwo Jima. — Elvis Mitchell

Mr. Rifkin, who also wrote the screenplay, has a gift for creating the atmosphere of grimy despair his subject requires, and for leavening the grim proceedings with touches of grotesque humor. But the visual intensity and the relentless degradation visited on the characters begins to feel prurient and dishonest: the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in their misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it. The problem, though, is not that he lacks the courage to contemplate futility and ruin, but that he's just a bit too eager. &#151; A. O. Scott

In spite of David Fincher's smooth, scary visual style, and his virtuosity with both traditional and computer-aided camera techniques, the movie is chilly and lacking in suspense. You pretty much know what will happen, and never really care about any of the characters. In the end, the movie is little more than a grisly, exceptionally well-directed entry in the &quot;Home Alone&quot; series. – A. O. Scott

To the film's intended audience of tweeners &#151; the newly identified demographic category that lies between fading childhood innocence and the full hormone rush of high adolescence &#151; the answer to that question would be as obvious at it is to the film's young hero, Zak (Jesse Bradford). The power to stop time is, of course, best used to impress girls. If &quot;Clockstoppers&quot; had been made for a slightly older audience, Zak's first stop would probably have been the girls' shower room.  But as directed by  Jonathan Frakes, the film's spirit owes more to the old-fashioned idealism of Tom Swift and the Hardy Boys than it does to the rowdiness of &quot;American Pie.&quot; – Dave Kehr

Her fine work with Jim Broadbent, as her husband, who has to cope with her loss of her faculties, is fine; he is shocked when overcome by waves of resentment. The picture is drained by clumsy crosscutting to the adventures of the young, libertine Iris (Kate Winslet), and the fragmentation lessens &quot;Iris&quot; as a drama. &#151; Elvis Mitchell"

Andrew Repasky McElhinney's &quot;Chronicle of Corpses&quot; is a gothic horror tale set in the early 19th century on the grounds of a dying slave plantation somewhere in the Middle Atlantic states. Though once the center of a thriving economy, the plantation has degenerated into inertia and neglect, largely as a result of the deepening decadence of its ruling family.  Shooting on 16-millimeter film and using a cast drawn largely from local theater groups, Mr. McElhinney has created a movie that is not without the flaws endemic in low-budget productions but still projects an amazing degree of stylistic assurance and originality. - Dave Kehr"

The movie wants to be a kind  of screwball caper movie, with Mr. Beesley's Charlie a cheeky rogue descendant of  Cary Grant or Chevy  Chase. But the screenplay (by Annette Goliti-Gutierrez) never begins to finds a workable balance between wit and adventure. And the performances in several smaller roles are so mechanical that they lend &quot;Kill Me Later&quot; the tone of a vanity production. - Stephen Holden

The plot of &quot;Princess&quot; is based on a lightning-strikes idea reduced to the voltage of a firefly. Mia (Anne Hathaway), an awkward 15-year-old in San Francisco, discovers that she is actually a princess. It would be wish-fulfillment for most girls, except that her dream is to be invisible. Clarisse (Julie Andrews), the grandmother she has never known, turns out to be the queen of Genovia, which from the look of things in this blandly reassuring comedy, must be a small principality just outside Brentwood. - Elvis Mitchell"

The most original thing about it is the audacity it took to use the word &quot;original&quot; in the title. Mr. Banderas is a worldly coffee plantation owner who discovers his naivete after Ms. Jolie — who he actually gets to call shameless — hoodwinks him in the game of love. Spiritually and financially bankrupt, he chases her. Every single incident is overdramatized, and the whole thing, filmed by the talented cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, has been lighted like the lobby of a Philippe Starck hotel. - Elvis Mitchell

At this moment you are probably rolling your eyes and thinking, &quot;Haven't I seen this before?&quot; Well, yes and no. The director, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, has made a specialty of taking familiar genres and infusing them with strange emotions and troubling insights, and he turns the thriller into a vehicle for gloomy social criticism. Rather than resort to clever plot twists and reversals, Mr. Kurosawa constructs an elaborate psychological maze and then strands us in the middle of it. The final scene is a piece of cunning visual wit that makes you realize how artful and sneaky &quot;Cure&quot; has been beneath its clinical, deadpan surface.— A. O. Scott"

Asexual and loud, the new film has been reconfigured for 6-year-olds with an ending that's really surprising. (It doesn't make any sense.) Mark Wahlberg is the hero this time, an American astronaut who's flung through a wormhole and crash-lands on a world where apes rule. Polite and steely, he is simply cast as the good guy instead of fulfilling the role. In Tim Burton's version, the apes don't bounce like marionettes; they're proud to be apes, and in the scary battle scenes, they charge across a field like thundering primates. This stampede of hairy cannonballs is a bad dream come to life. Helena Bonham Carter is an ape with sympathies for mistreated humans and she uses her voice resourcefully. But the movie belongs to Tim Roth, as the preening, ambitious General Thade - so much so that he even gets the best makeup job. - Elvis Mitchell

Filming on location in and around the now uber-chic ski resort of Telluride, Colo., Mr. Hanson succeeds amazingly well in turning the clock back 30 years, to a time when Telluride (appearing here under the pseudonym of Ajax) was a remote outpost populated by ski bums, substance abusers and a few prescient real estate developers. &#151; Dave Kehr"

Mr. Winstone's slow-moving magnetism is a perfect foil for Mr. Kingsley's terrifying intensity. Amanda Redman, as Gal's tough and devoted wife, helps to give the picture a welcome and unexpected depth of feeling. - A. O. Scott"

This time, Mr. Lawrence is a professional thief who becomes obsessed with Danny DeVito, a white-collar criminal. The picture turns into a cobweb of tricky spins and twists that seems like a hip-hop of version of &quot;Ruthless People,&quot; with everyone falling back on his specialty.

Fortunately, his cool can't insulate him from Bernie Mac, who plays his fence, Uncle Jack, as if he already owns the picture and is scouting for the best price he can get. But if Uncle Jack bursts onto the screen, it's William Fichtner's rococo turn that's hard to watch and take your eyes off.

But rarely has a movie so technically proficient been so conceptually bankrupt. Kate Beckinsale, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett -- playing two American pilots and a nurse embroiled in a nonsensical love triangle -- do what they can with the thudding, expository

Shrek (voiced by Myers) just wants to be alone. If he can deliver Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) for Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) to marry, Farquaad will ensure that Shrek's swamp is restored to its isolated status. Much of &quot;Shrek&quot; is scrappy, brash comedy, and the brio of the actors adds to the dynamism.

The viewer wants Mr. Tuzman and Mr. Herman to succeed, but it is evident that  they don't have the tools to make govWorks thrive. The drama is in the interactions at the office, where an early crucial misstep costs the partners an important alliance. They fear that mistake will come back to haunt them.

The film, written by Mr. Spade and Fred Wolf, teeters on the fine line between condescending and corrupt, because it makes fun of Joe, who is a hapless trailer denizen, but also wants us to feel sorry for him. &#151; Elvis Mitchell

The plot complications include Lance's trying to court an African-American social activist (Regina King) while he's trapped in the body of a white man, and still get onstage at the Apollo. There are a few funny ideas, which are reminiscent of the deadly riffing that Rock is capable of, and he shows new confidence as an actor. This picture, by the directors of &quot;American Pie,&quot; doesn't quite work as a romantic comedy: it's a little timid and recycled, despite some great supporting performances by Eugene Levy, Wanda Sykes and Mark Addy. — Elvis Mitchell

(Frankie R. Faison supplies the other warmth.) Julianne Moore, as the F.B.I. agent Clarice Starling, is game but almost superfluous: Hannibal himself is rendered in such operatic terms that you half expect Hopkins to burst into an Andrew Lloyd Webber song.

Michael Douglas is the new American drug czar, Catherine Zeta-Jones the ruthless wife of a busted drug lord and Benicio Del Toro a Mexican policeman.

Costner's moving to the sidelines is as ostentatious as his Boston Brahmin accent — he seems to be channeling Vaughn Meader.

It invents elements to make its rather obvious point about the price exacted by art and the state that liberals trying to do what's right can be whipped into. Fortunately, the elegance of Philip Kaufman's direction and his handling of the cast make for the kind of euphoric stylishness that has been missing from moviegoing for some time. Much of that élan comes from Geoffrey Rush, who plays Sade as a gleeful voluptuary unfettered by either morality or what for him would be the most venal of sins, sentimentality. Sade has been confined to the Charenton Asylum, and, for him, this is merely slumming, a time when he gets to evaluate the damaged and discarded psyches that litter the rooms and decide which is his most apt target. And Mr. Kaufman revels in the chaos. — Elvis Mitchell"

The movie takes the action form, which often attacks the screen with energy and movement, and creates a placid surface that offers a new perspective and a spirituality not normally found in these pictures. In terms of action nothing much takes place for the first 10 minutes. That's so he can set up the incredibly complicated plot, which has as much romance, intrigue, free-wheeling action   —   and rousing silliness   —   as any five Hong Kong throw-down fests. This is no small feat, given the dizzying amount of exposition in these movies.  Outrageous plot pile-ons certainly take place in &quot;Tiger&quot;   —   a practice as ritualistic as having a martial arts master and student square off against each other, also a part of the picture.

Maquiling creates an unusual and intriguing tone somewhere between sharp, deadpan comedy and a soft, dreamy surrealism.

Ms. Rodriguez is like a female Marlon Brando, with an overpowering, slow-burning charisma that few actresses of any era can match. Her performance is a knockout. &#151; A. O. Scott"

As Selma, a Czech immigrant factory worker going blind in the early 1960's in Washington State (the film was shot in Sweden), Bjork seems to be inventing a whole new style of film acting, and her performance is miraculous. von Trier, continuing his campaign to rescue the art of film from complacency and convention, follows Selma's utter annihilation with sadistic relish. &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; is both stupefyingly bad and utterly overpowering; it can elicit, sometimes within a single scene, a gasp of rapture and a spasm of revulsion.

The story is not much: a retired professor in postwar Tokyo lives out his twilight years in the glow of his former students' devotion and declares his unreadiness to say farewell to the life he lives with humor and gusto. But Kurosawa's absolute assurance as a filmmaker and his unabashed affection for his characters make ''Madadayo'' a richly, and in a way inexplicably, satisfying movie. &#151; A. O. Scott"

As played by Mike White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie (Chris Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Mr. Arteta's visual sense, Mr. White's insightful script and strong supporting performances from Mr. Weitz and his brother Sam, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ''Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year. &#151; A.

The movie employs modeled latex figures to tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Nick Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Peter Lord's continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority. ''Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ''Stalag 17'' to ''Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Mel Gibson, the voice of Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the hens to fly. Finally, it shows that the hens can save themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Julia Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal of this. — Elvis Mitchell"

In addition to its technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Jean Tripplehorn and Stellan Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of pathos. Whether ''Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky curio is for the future to decide.

But the movie is undermined by Brian De Palma's uncharacteristic wet-eyed awe. All this addled sincerity comes from trying to create wonderment for adults, growing out of a morose astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity on Mars. Gary Sinise plays the depressed astronaut, and his thoughtful patience makes him appear to be a little sluggish, though not as sluggish as the movie: narratively it seems to be taking place in zero gravity, where each minute seems to last an additional 30 seconds. In space no one can hear you snore. &#151; Elvis Mitchell

Although the lighting never gets as pitch dark as the title implies, the movie is scary enough to make you remember when you needed a night light to get to sleep. And Vin Diesel, as a hulking, thuggish convicted murderer who turns out not to be as evil as he first appears, demonstrates major action-hero potential. &#151; Stephen Holden"

He moves between the preening Fidel (Jose Zuniga), a yuppie Colombian thug, and Fulvio (Oliver Platt), whose vulgar pride in his violent streak is perverse.

Like the others, ''Scream3'' belongs on the Cartoon Network. This time for a better reason: the film is funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jobs to the spine. Wes Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real competition is not the recent hit films ''The Blair Witch Project'' or ''The Sixth Sense,'' but rather ''Scream'' itself. ''Scream 3'' doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much as personality show as it is a slasher film. &#151; Elvis Mitchell

Gwyneth Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness of a fine character actress, while Cate Blanchett makes the delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante.

His most endearing client (Jason Lee) is a warm, fuzzy billionaire computer nerd who loves to skateboard but finds it's lonely at the top. Mumford's moral ambiguity (he's both a hero and a fraud) keeps this delightful Frank Capraesque fable of self-invention from becoming too sappy. &#151; Stephen Holden"

All this re-examination of the atmosphere of the post-Sputnik era is wrapped up in the story of a bright (and therefore unpopular) little boy who befriends a 50-foot-tall iron robot from who knows where that plunges into the sea one stormy night in 1957 and comes ashore near Rockwell, Me. The boy, Hogarth Hughes, saves the giant when it becomes entangled in high-tension wires, and the big lug becomes his secret playmate. Meanwhile, a nasty, paranoid Government agent is closing in on the giant, leading to a showdown with the military. &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking. Many parents will doubtless approve of the film's messages while they ponder how the passing years have smoothed the jagged edges of history. — Lawrence Van Gelder"

It is also a smart, pointed satire that demolishes the hypocrisy of a conservative culture that allows almost unlimited violence and gore in movies and on television but goes ballistic at the prospect of children's being exposed to dirty language and sexual explicitness. When a group of tykes sneak into a Canadian movie filled with obscenities and come home spewing smut, their parents raise such a ruckus that the United States declares war on Canada. Armageddon looms when the Devil, who has been having a troubled affair with the recently deceased Saddam Hussein, decides to put in an appearance. Contributing to the madness are 15 clever songs spoofing everything from Rodgers and Hammerstein to &quot;Les Miserables.&quot; — Stephen Holden"

With shaggy, baggy looks that belie his performance's fine comic control, Jeff Bridges plays a guy who truly deserves to be called Dude, and is by turns oblivious and indignant once a ruined rug leads him into neo-noir escapades. In a film that certainly keeps its audience guessing what might happen next (Saddam Hussein renting bowling shoes?), John Turturro takes the cake as the most fiendish of bowlers. — Janet Maslin"

Despite the astonishing technological advances behind James Cameron's great visual spectacle, gimmicks are never allowed to intrude on the film's central illusion: that the audience is drawn back into the Gilded Age and intimately involved in the fateful voyage. For all its painstaking historical detail, this &quot;Titanic&quot; proves anything but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of its sights and the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young lovers whose romance is skillfully interwoven with real historical detail, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry. With his &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; -caliber ambitions, Mr. Cameron dared to dream of the impossible and came up with the movie of the year. - Janet Maslin"

Closer than ever to cartoon superhero status, James Bond this time appears in what could almost be a generic summer blockbuster, if not for its hero's being chronically overdressed. The Hong Kong action star Michelle Yeoh tries to kick some life into the proceedings, but the film is dominated by gadgets, monotones and explosions that happen on cue. Best supporting performers: Jonathan Pryce as a power-hungry media mogul, and a BMW that works on remote control.

Following the ''Nashville'' blueprint, Paul Thomas Anderson explores the quaint customs and inchoate longings within an insular pop subculture, this time the sleazy, druggy universe of 70's porn. From spectacular party sequences to clear proof that the party is over, this busy, wildly colorful film has no trouble holding interest -- far from it. But its extravagant length is a tactical mistake, since it promises bigger ideas than Mr. Anderson delivers. Mark Wahlberg gives a terrifically appealing performance in the story's tricky central role. Prominently featured in the fine ensemble cast are Burt Reynolds, doing his best and most suavely funny work in years as a porn auteur, and Julianne Moore as his ethereal, vaguely tragic star. Minor details, like her hilariously bad porn acting or the flashy period costumes, are an evil treat. — Janet Maslin"

Adapting Rick Moody's observant novel, the director of ''Sense and Sensibility'' uses his own quiet acuity to make a Connecticut bedroom community, circa 1973, seem as strange and distant as any Austeniana; no, much more so. Beautifully and mournfully acted, especially by those who play the women of this well-heeled Pompeii.

Directed by Frank Oz with a sure hand for ''Birdcage'' humor and written by the dependably hilarious Paul Rudnick, it skewers gay and straight stereotypes with the help of a fine supporting cast. Mr. Kline plays a small-town high school teacher shocked by the suggestion, made to a billion viewers of the Academy Awards show, that he is gay. Among those sent into shock by this thought are Joan Cusack as his alarmed fiancee, Debbie Reynolds in another wicked Mom role, and Wilford Brimley as the father who earnestly asks his son, ''Will you be goin' into show business?'' Matt Dillon, Bob Newhart and Tom Selleck heighten the screwball fun. &#151 Janet Maslin"

It is also a computer- and video-age tribute to Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film ''Blow Up'' that explores the limitations of truth as revealed through pictures. Bill Pullman is bracingly feisty as a producer of action-adventure films whose macho brio is shattered after he is carjacked and nearly killed, and he goes into hiding. Andie MacDowell is his neglected wife who seizes his empire after his disappearance. Gabriel Byrne is the ambivalent mastermind behind an elaborate surveillance system that the Government is secretly testing in Los Angeles. While monitoring that system, he is witness to a crime he doesn't understand. Ry Cooder composed the gorgeous, shivering musical score. &#151; Stephen Holden"

John Schultz brings a fond, knowing perspective to the world of the garage band, but his previous experience making promotional documentaries about Steven Spielberg movies also shows. Sweet and rueful, with a fresh, likable cast, solid comic timing and a chatty tone that owes much to Richard Linklater and Kevin Smith. Matthew Hennessey, as the group's drummer, shows off a slacker's gift of gab, while Kevin Corrigan plays a more stoned, seasoned rocker with a body that goes fishing, a mind ''somewhere between the tangerine trees and the marmalade skies.'' This breezy independent film places as high a value on spontaneity and freedom as its characters do. A laid-back good time. — Janet Maslin"

In the process of perfecting their dance act (to the thump of a wonderfully incongruous disco beat), these lovable lugs learn a thing or two about masculinity. Brightly acted and casually hilarious, the film exploits this gimmick in witty, trenchant ways that are always generous, never cruel. Peter Cattaneo's winning feature debut understands that joblessness is a humiliation well beyond nakedness, but it also revels in the sight of downtrodden ex-workers learning to enjoy their new freedom. This comedy is cheerfully raunchy but doesn't embarrass its cast with frontal nudity. Scrappy Robert Carlyle, also of ''Trainspotting,'' emerges as a star. — Janet Maslin"

These qualities are embodied not only in Mr. Campbell's haunted eyes and sunken lips but also in a rich musical voice whose oratorical roll enfolds many quivering notes, including several shades of hysteria. Although the movies haven't lacked for Hamlets recently, Ethan Hawke and Kenneth Branagh being the latest stars to have weighed in, Mr. Scott's is something that must be seen. It is, in a word, compelling. - Stephen Holden

In her new environs the girl combats her grief by taking over a bunch of goose eggs uprooted by a developer's bulldozer, helping them hatch and, in a charmingly unsentimental story of a girl and her birds, raising the goslings. Later Thomas devises a flying machine that helps instruct the geese how to fly south for the winter. The film turns a potentially treacly children's story into an exhilarating 90's fable. -- Janet Maslin
